The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft.

Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter.

While other shows in this category were also strong contenders, such as Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” “Hacks” proved to be a favorite in this category with its first season. “Hacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,” announced the official Golden Globes account via Twitter. “Congratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best Musical/Comedy Series.” Best Television Series — Drama: “Succession” HBO’s “Succession” was the big winner at this year’s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.", "On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams.

The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.", "Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year. Similar to NBC’s stance, many actors were absent in a statement to demand change.

While the HFPA has announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain. Despite the controversy, though, many films and television shows have much to celebrate as their casts and crews were recognized for their hard work.  Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy: “West Side Story” After receiving 4 nominations, Steven Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation of the 1957 musical dominated the Comedy/Musical category at the 79th Golden Globe Awards. “West Side Story,” won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture — Musical/Comedy and Best Supporting Actress Role — Motion Picture (Ariana DeBose).

GO FURTHER The Bengals can’t do that to Joe Burrow again — ever. Super Bowl LVI takeaways February 14, 2022 at 8:48 AM EST If Matthew Stafford was finally going to get his Super Bowl ring, it really had to happen like this: a hobbled Stafford, trailing in the fourth quarter, needing a late drive to win the whole thing. How many times did Detroit fans see that same script over the years?  The first time the Lions saw that magic came in Stafford’s eighth NFL start, against the Browns, when he was just 21 years old.", "After taking a hit that rendered his left arm almost immobile, Stafford fought off the team’s trainers to get back on the field and then threw a last-second, game-winning touchdown to Brandon Pettigrew.  It was rough in those early days. Stafford started just three games in 2010, as that ugly “injury-prone” tag started to swirl around him. He came back in 2011 to lead the league in passing attempts and guide Detroit to a surprising playoff berth.  Those images from Sunday night — Stafford on stage, wearing a Super Bowl hat after the Rams beat the Bengals 23-20, bathing in confetti — were what Lions fans dreamed of for so long.

The man many consider to be the best football player on the planet now has won the ring he was missing, the only thing left to complete his stellar football resume.", "Super Bowl 56 was full of noteworthy, impactful performances — but only one that could result in Super Bowl MVP. Two players stood out above all others in that race for Super Bowl 56 MVP: Rams receiver Cooper Kupp and defensive lineman Aaron Donald. Both were instrumental to their teams' success in the 23-20 victory. Both had impactful plays in huge moments, including in the final stages of the final game of the season. Only one could take home some (additional) hardware, though: MORE:  History of Super Bowl MVP award winners Kupp won his first Super Bowl ring and MVP following his Super Bowl 56 performance against the Bengals. The fifth-year receiver out of Eastern Washington followed up his All-Pro season with one last impressive performance, catching a game-high eight passes for a team-high 92 yards and two touchdowns.

COOPER KUPP FOR THE LEAD!", "A look: After Beckham was hurt, Kupp had just two catches for 22 yards before the Rams' final offensive series. To create chances for Kupp, McVay decided to go with some tempo, eschewing a huddle in hopes of slowing down the Bengals' pass rush and forcing them into more basic zone coverages. Kupp found soft spots in that zone, and Stafford found Kupp. On that final drive, Kupp had four catches for 39 yards, a 7-yard carry for a first down on fourth-and-1 and the winning score. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, Kupp is the second player with four-plus receptions on a go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter or later of a Super Bowl, joining Pittsburgh's Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII. That came despite the Bengals' best effort to keep Kupp from getting the ball. Before the final touchdown, Kupp drew three straight penalties -- a defensive holding, a defensive pass interference and an unnecessary roughness -- to set up the final score. \"Once we got down in the tight red area, it felt like it was about 60 plays for us to be able to finally get that one in on the fade,\" McVay said. \"And Cooper Kupp is the man.\" Kupp's Super Bowl heroics put the finishing touches on a stellar season in which he cemented himself as one of the league's best players.", "📺: #SBLVI on NBC 📱: https://t.co/K02y40b5Nu pic.twitter.com/vhHjVNRsnC MORE: Cooper Kupp stats: Where does Rams receiver's historic season rank in NFL history Kupp was also instrumental in the Rams' final go-ahead drive: He converted fourth-and-1 at the Rams' 37 with a 7-yard end-around and also caught three passes for 38 yards prior to his game-winning catch.

The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes.

Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip. That won’t be the case this year with the iPhone 14 chip.  According to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max chip won’t get an upgrade this year.", "Splash, Water, and Dust Resistant Rated IP68 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes) under IEC standard 60529 · Chip.

While potential iPhone 14 buyers probably won’t have to worry too much about performance — the A15 still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks — there is the question of longevity. While Apple has a great track record when it comes to long-term software support for its phones, I still have to wonder if the iPhone 14’s chip means that it’ll get one or two fewer iOS updates.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Reviews of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were positive, highlighting the major new feature such as an always-on display with a new Dynamic Island, upgraded cameras with a 48-megapixel main lens, car crash detection and satellite connectivity for emergencies, the A16 Bionic chip for faster performance, and new Deep Purple and Space Black color options.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission.

Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers.

Rybakina beat world No. 3 Ons Jabeur in three sets, coming from a set down to win 3-6 6-2 6-2.            The 23-year-old, appearing in her first grand slam final, started slowly but gradually found her rhythm and powerful serve to overcome Jabeur.            Rybakina, who was born in Russia but has represented Kazakhstan since 2018, was the youngest women’s finalist at Wimbledon since 2015 when Garbine Muguruza was 21.            But at the end of an enthralling encounter, Rybakina lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish aloft as she was named Wimbledon champion for the first time.            In her interview on court afterwards, Rybakina’s first emotion was one of relief.            “I was super nervous before the match, during the match and I’m happy it’s finished,” she told Sue Barker on Center Court.            “Really I have never felt something like this. I want to thank the crowd for the support, it was unbelievable these two weeks.           “But also I want to congratulate Ons for a great match and everything you have achieved. I think you are an inspiration for everybody. You have an amazing game.", "She also liked that she didn’t have to worry about any gusts or the sun or anything else while playing — a reminder of days practicing at indoor courts during winters in Prague. “I always play good indoors,” Vondrousova said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, maybe that’s going to help me.’” On this afternoon, she trailed in each set but collected the last four games of the first, then the last three games of the second as Jabeur fell to 0-3 in major finals. The 28-year-old from Tunisia is the only Arab woman and only North African woman to make it that far in singles at any Grand Slam tournament. “You cannot force things,” the sixth-seeded Jabeur said. “It wasn’t meant to be.” She lost to Elena Rybakina 12 months ago at the All England Club and to No. 1 Iga Swiatek at the U.S. Open last September. “I think this is the most painful loss of my career,” Jabeur said Saturday, pausing to wipe away tears. Vondrousova’s surge to her Slam title was hard to envision at the start of this fortnight. She was 1-4 in previous appearances on Wimbledon’s grass, only once making it as far as the second round, before going 7-0 on a run that included wins against five seeded foes.", "Filed under: The #17 seed upset the #3 seed in the women’s final.

Rybakina’s previous Wimbledon best performance was reaching last year’s fourth round. Her previous Grand Slam best was a quarterfinals appearance at the 2021 French Open. Jabeur entered the match as a -155 favorite at DraftKings Sportsbook and she cruised through the first set, winning 6-3. However, Rybakina quickly turned things around.

The carpet, which changes from year to year, was colored red, white, and blue to represent the American flag and the 2022 theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" This year, the theme is \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" a homage to the legacy of the late designer and fashion-industry icon Karl Lagerfeld. The decorations and red carpet will likely be different from years past to reflect the new theme. The 2022 dress code was \"gilded glamour,\" inspired by the Gilded Age of New York City. To match the theme and dress code of the night, Shane Valentino designed the centerpiece to represent the Statue of Liberty's eternal flame.", "For this reason, guests must abide by the no phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy.

Alphabet on Tuesday reported a net profit of $13.9 billion in the third quarter, down 27 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbed 6 percent to $69.1 billion. The earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates of $16.9 billion in profit on $71 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet.

Quite the opposite: The comments from Pichai and Porat clearly indicate that the only factor that could impact that willingness to “invest meaningfully” is Google Cloud’s ability to sustain the hypergrowth-level momentum it has demonstrated over the past couple of years.

College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast, but it’s not getting the traction she’s hoping for. This doesn’t affect her determination and Susie is persistent in making a name for herself. In a world of fans, how can you stand out? When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.

College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast, ...", "Not enough data yet, please check again later. Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has never met a mystery she couldn’t solve. At least not when it comes to those that populate the crime books her mother (Jammie Patton’s Anne) read to her as a child. It got to the point where she wondered if they should stop reading them altogether, but Susie refused. She didn’t care that she always guessed the culprit. All she cared about was spending time with Mom. So when Anne’s MS diagnosis advanced enough to take away her speech, Susie took over reading duties to keep the tradition alive. And she even took things one step further by choosing to make her mother’s wish come true: using her knack for literary detective work to do good in the world and become famous. Unlike her college’s quasi-celebrity Jessie (Alex Wolff), however, you can’t just post something online and become an overnight sensation. He’s a confident white man oozing charisma as he stumbles his way through what he calls “meditation” videos pulling thousands of views. She’s a socially awkward Black woman with braces who’s older than everyone around her (nursing her mother while working means she can only devote enough study time for part-time student status) and started a well-researched deep-dive podcast into cold cases that only gets spam comments.", "What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it. There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in. What I liked most about Susie Searches is its take on the culture we live in, without settling for a lack of intelligence in the writing, with Kiersey Clemons proving she can run a film.The Blue Caftan (Maryam Touzani)The Blue Caftan (2022) – source: Toronto Film FestivalIn this beautifully touching TIFF gem, Mina (Lubna Azabal) and Halim (Saleh Bakri) own a caftan shop, where he hand sews garments in the Moroccan town of Salé.

Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.  Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day…and promote herself.  Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an investigator. But!", "Top cast · Director. Sophie Kargman · Writers.

Given what happens in the film, do you think she's a likable character? Should the audience empathize with her? Sophie Kargman: My hope is yes, [that we] elevate a genre film with a detailed character study about her quest for love and validation. That's a very human desire, especially in this time and space. This need and quest for instant fame. How far would someone go to get an audience? Susie is complicated. We see ourselves in her. If you could achieve your lifelong dream overnight, would you do it? How far would you go to be seen, to be noticed? Film made me a much more compassionate, open, empathetic human. People aren't good and bad. People are complicated. They're fallible. Susie wants a better life for her mom. Fame is a means to an end if she can just get her foot in the door. To me, she's incredibly likable. She's empathetic in spite of her choices. My hope is that you're rooting for her in spite of it all. MW: Let's spread the wealth to the other characters and supporting cast. Alex Wolff, Ken Marino, and Jim Gaffigan are so good here.

It then played at over two dozen festivals around the world before being acquired by Canal+ in France, Movistar in Spain, HBO Europe, and both Amazon and Apple TV+ in the United States. Kargman starred in Dev Patel’s directorial debut, “Home Shopper,” which garnered a Short Film Grand Jury Prize nomination following its premiere at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. The short was also shown at the 2018 Cannes Festival. As a writer, Kargman sold a true-crime series to Mark Gordon Company/eOne.  “Susie Searches” is screening at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, which is running from September 8-18.

One day, a fellow classmate at her community college goes missing, and she sees this as an opportunity to prove her sleuthing skills. The story goes off the rails from there, raising the question: how far would you go to capture an audience? W&H: What drew you to this story?", "Sharing anything more about the movie’s plot would be to give away its most entertaining pivots, so suffice it to say that you probably don’t know exactly where the story is going (and even if you think you do, you’ll still have some surprises in store). Kargman and Frank’s script moves briskly enough that there’s always something new to react to or think about. The production design and cinematography are slick — especially for a smaller movie — and the supporting cast boasts appearances by familiar, talented comedians like Ken Marino, Jim Gaffigan, Dolly Wells, and SNL’s Alex Moffat. But this is Clemons’ movie more than anyone else’s, and she delivers. Susie is always appealing, even when she’s making mistakes or dealing with the aftermath of those mistakes.

But as both she and Jesse become more well known, she starts to find herself becoming trapped in a web of her own making. Susie Searches is a twisty, fun, and engaging film. Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits. Other comedic actors, including Jim Gaffigan, Rachel Sennot, David Walton, and Ken Marino (who also shows off a more menacing side), also help make the film funny enough to lighten its heavy subject matter. Overall, Susie Searches is a funny and entertaining feature debut for writer-director Sophie Kargman. Families can talk about the tone of Susie Searches. Is it a comedy? A drama? A mystery?

When Alex said yes to doing Susie, I couldn't believe it. He is known for these incredible, but dark, heavy, and emotional characters. He is so funny, and yet he's never played someone that's sort of light and naive. He took Jesse to another level. He pierced his ear. He came to me with this really weird haircut, but I loved it. I've been a fan of Ken and Jim forever. I got very lucky with this cast. Rachel Sennott is astounding. I've been a fan of Rachel's since Shiva Baby. Sophie Kargman: I can't speak enough about this cast without mentioning Meredith Tucker, our extraordinary casting director. Meredith cast White Lotus and Eighth Grade. We were very much in step the whole way through. This was an interesting role for Ken. Has the actor ever played a character like this? If yes, then they probably won't say yes. If no, that's exciting. You want your actors to be like, \"This is exciting. I've never done this before.\" That's why I went after them. They have this unbelievable pastiche of wonderful work, but nothing quite like this. That's why I'm hoping that this would resonate and it did.

Leslie Combemale The co-directors chose their lead well in Kiersey Clemons, who does a great job at not telegraphing where the story is going, and allows the audience lots of choices in terms of allegiance. The camera work is almost another character, but never becomes distracting, nor does it go too over the top. There’s so a strong collaborative feeling to the performances and the way they play against each other. It’s not entirely new as a story, but adds a flavor to the mystery coming-of-age subgenre not offered in quite this way before, while centering a strong Black female lead. Jennifer Merin  Susie Searches is an enjoyably affable coming of age thriller about a teenage girl who is known for her uncanny ability to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes, and who shares the details of her her super sleuth searches and suspicions on her popular podcast. She’s also determined to further investigations by the local sheriff’s office where she is an intern. But, up close and personal, Susie is actually rather shy and, wrapped up in the coming of age issues of self esteem and teenage sexual curiosity, she hides her vulnerability behind a smile that shines through aqua-colored braces.

Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week.

Since the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments.", "We use cookies to provide our services and for analytics and marketing.

Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.

Japan’s longest serving prime minister, he was also perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history. Abe, who was assassinated Friday, angered both liberals at home and World War II victims in Asia with his hawkish push to revamp the military and his revisionist view that Japan was given an unfair verdict by history for its brutal past. At the same time, he revitalized Japan’s economy, led efforts for the nation to take a stronger role in Asia and served as a rare beacon of political stability before stepping down two years ago for health reasons. “He’s the most towering political figure in Japan over the past couple of decades,” said Dave Leheny, a political scientist at Waseda University. “He wanted Japan to be respected on the global stage in the way that he felt was deserved. ... He also wanted Japan to not have to keep apologizing for World War II.” Abe, who died after being shot during a campaign speech, was 67.", "(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Chinese paramilitary policemen march infront of the Japanese embassy where the Japanese flag is flown at half staff to commemorate the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Saturday, July 9, 2022, in Beijing.

Ernaux was born in 1940 in France. Her first book, Cleaned Out, in 1974, was an autobiographical novel about obtaining an abortion when it was still illegal in France.

Quotes have been edited slightly for clarity. You can listen to the full conversation here. Ben Bernanke, distinguished senior fellow in residence with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings, is among three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in economic sciences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. On Monday, October 10, the Brookings Institution hosted a press conference to hear his thoughts on the award and discuss his research on banks and financial crises.  The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time. In the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Bernanke’s 1983 American Economic Review paper on banking and the Great Depression. Bernanke noted that looking back on the study, although it looked “a little primitive,” it had many fruitful ideas.", "Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Jane Eyre, the tales of Grimm and Andersen, David Copperfield, Gone with the Wind, and later Les Misérables, The Grapes of Wrath, Nausea, The Stranger: chance, more than the school's prescriptions, determined what I read.\"[23]  Ernaux received her Nobel diploma and medal from Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden, on 10 December 2022. Nobel Committee chairman Anders Olsson described her as an author who regards \"language [as] a means to dispel the fog of memory and a knife to uncover the real\".[25] He noted:  \"Annie Ernaux’s writing is restrained with feelings and expressions of emotion, but passion pulses beneath the surface. Relentlessly, Ernaux exposes the shame that penetrates class experience... An unrelenting gaze and a plain style are [her] characteristics, and that she succeeds in making her pain relevant to all.[25]  In her banquet speech at Stockholm City Hall on 10 December 2022, Ernaux hailed Albert Camus, who was awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature.[26] She said:  \"I was seventeen in 1957, when I heard on the radio that Albert Camus had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in Stockholm.", "And when she with great courage and clinical acuity reveals the agony of the experience of class, describing shame, humiliation, jealousy or inability to see who you are, she has achieved something admirable and enduring.

For more than a century, these academic institutions have worked independently to select Nobel Prize laureates. Several outreach organisations and activities have been developed to inspire generations and disseminate knowledge about the Nobel Prize.", "Annie Ernaux, who was among others a teacher in literature at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, wrote about 20 novels as what she calls “impersonal biography”. And this original form of literature inspired French president Macron, who saluted her achievement on Twitter by saying “for 50 years, Annie Ernaux has written the novel of the collective and intimate memory of our country. Her voice is the voice of the freedom of women and forgotten figures of the century”. The tweet of the French ministry of culture felt the same emotion, when she talked about the “crowning of an intimate work that carries the life of others” and shows a “delicate and dense writing that revolutionised literature”.    The Nobel Prize in Literature tends to be considered as the most prestigious and covered prize. Annie Ernaux now joins 16 prestigious French predecessors who received the prize before her. They include major French writers who became true leading figures of international literature of the 20th century: The French Agency for the promotion of higher education,international student services, and international mobility.", "Her famous works include La Place (\"A Man's Place\", 1983), L'événement (\"Happening\", 2000), Se perdre (\"Getting Lost\", 2001), L'Occupation (\"The Possession\", 2002), and Les Années (\"The Years\", 2008).[8]   Following the announcement, Carin Klaesson interviewed Nobel Committee chairman Anders Olsson. Asked why Ernaux was the 2022 laureate in Literature, he gave the following statement:  \"She's a wonderful writer. She has really renewed literature in many ways. On one hand, I mean, she has her foot in the French tradition, the heritage of Marcel Proust, and these kinds of search for the roots of her experience in childhood and so forth that are very important for her. But also she guides these search in a quite new direction and in a more social context, and that is a wonderful inner portraits of appearance for instance. She gives also back these heritage, of these poor and ambitious people living in the countryside, and she does it with so clear, a certain look that is unwavering. It's a very strong prose, both brief and uncompromising at the same time.\"[9]  Interviewed by Claire Paetku, correspondent of the Nobel Prize's Outreach, Annie Ernaux confessed she learned about her win at around one o'clock while she was in her kitchen listening to her radio.", "or or or This year, Nobel Prizes seem to love France, and France loves Nobel Prizes! In the wake of the Nobel Prize in Physics granted on 4 October to French researcher Alain Aspect, Annie Ernaux received her Nobel Prize in Literature, an especially honourable prize for France, on 6 October. Annie Ernaux is the first French woman to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded to a writer who “in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction” France can boast counting with 16 laureates of Nobel Prizes in Literature, leader of most awarded countries.     Annie Ernaux was awarded the Prize “for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory, declared the Nobel communication committee when awarding the Prize. This prize recompenses all her work, which is mostly autobiographical, and her work turned her in a prominent French feminist figure. When contacted by media in the wake of the announcement, Ernaux expressed “great honour” for her Prize, but also a “great responsibility” that is now hers to continue to show “some sort of justness, justice, with the world”.", "With the UK experiencing self-inflicted financial market turmoil, and growing concerns about economic fragility across the world, the work of the new laureates feels particularly timely. Their research has greatly improved our understanding of the role of banks – in normal times and in crises. The Nobel Prize in economics – or to use its proper title, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel – is awarded annually to an economist or economists who have contributed to the advancement of economics.  The prize has not been without criticism. The 1997 award to Myron Scholes and Robert Merton for option pricing theory was subsequently criticised when Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that implemented their theories and on whose board they sat, collapsed in 1998. More recently, it has been argued that the Nobel Prize has had a malign effect on the discipline of economics in that it has legitimised free-market thinking and deregulatory economic policy (Offer and Söderberg, 2016).

Very early in her career, she turned away from fiction to focus on autobiography, combining historic and individual experiences. In her different viewpoints, she consistently examines a life marked by strong disparities regarding gender, language and class. Her path to authorship was long and arduous, and all her oeuvres are written in plain language. Her books are followed by a wide readership, and are reviewed in most local and national newspapers in France, as well as being the subject of many radio and television interviews and programmes, and a large and growing international academic literature.", "Search the site   The 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences went to Ben Bernanke and Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, largely in honour of papers they published in 1983. This column addresses criticisms that Diamond and Dybvig did nothing but mathematically formalise something everyone already knew, or should have known, and that Bernanke was rewarded less for his research than for his later role as a policymaker.    The 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences went to Ben Bernanke, a household name, and Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, who were largely unknown to the public but immensely influential within the profession. Few economists predicted the 2008 financial crisis, but when it happened, few found it baffling; in the days after the fall of Lehman, economists could in effect be found roaming the halls of their departments, muttering “Diamond-Dybvig, Diamond-Dybvig.” This year’s prize was, in a way, unusual. Nobel prizes in the hard sciences are generally given for one important piece of research; economics Nobels are typically more like lifetime achievement awards. This time, however, the award largely honoured one seminal paper, Diamond and Dybvig’s 1983 “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” together with Bernanke’s paper of the same year, “Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression.", "Oct 6, 2022 ...

This post originally appeared on Chicago Booth’s Initiative on Global Markets. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke of the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond at Chicago and Philip Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis “for their research on banks and financial crises”. Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "Oct 10, 2022 ...

But whereas Intergang is normally known for harnessing advanced weaponry and tech against heroes like Superman, it seems Gregor is turning to the supernatural realm in his fight against Black Adam and the Justice Society.   It's pretty clear already that the DCEU version of Sabbac isn't a particularly close adaptation of any of the comic book incarnations. He may instead draw elements from all three.

Gregor was quite obsessed with finding the powers of Sabbac and with the help of his men went on a witch hunt to acquire it.

Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother, will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap. The character is said to be a spiritual successor to Beckett, who has been missing for 30 years, and Seong finds himself trapped in the 1980s after he uses the technology on himself.", "'Quantum Leap': Melissa Roxburgh Revealed As Season 2 Premiere Guest Star In ...

He's a man lost in the past, jumping from body to body in an effort to get back home. The pilot episode thrusts Dr. Seong back to 1989, where he must work to prevent a terrible tragedy from taking place amid the San Francisco Earthquake that occurred that same year.

It’s worth noting that the Asus TUF RTX 4090 matches Nvidia’s $1,599 MSRP, so you won’t have to fork out more for the overclocked card. I’d argue the cooling efficacy of the model’s Axial-tech setup makes picking the variant over the original reference design worthwhile, but its extra chonk contributes to the GPU’s unattractive form.    At the moment, you can grab a Zotac RTX 3090 Ti for under $1,000, – a former flagship graphics card still packs a serious 4K punch.

Since its introduction on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is always snatched up like hotcakes.

You're not alone. NVIDIA is \"unlaunching\" the 12GB RTX 4080 over concerns they're confusing. While the company still believes the 12GB version is a solid video card, it said the lower-spec model is \"not named right.\" The company didn't say if or how it might relaunch the card, and didn't elaborate further when reached for comment. The 16GB RTX 4080 is still on track to launch November 16th at a price of $1,199 for NVIDIA's Founders Edition. This effectively raises the base price for RTX 40-level hardware. This might not be as bad as it sounds, mind you. The 12GB edition was supposed to start at $899, although its dependence on third-party manufacturers was likely to raise real-world pricing higher. The muddled messaging largely stems from differences beyond RAM quantities. Where the 12GB model includes 7,680 CUDA (general-purpose processing) cores and a 192-bit memory bus, its higher-end counterpart offers 9,728 cores and a 256-bit bus. You're getting a considerably slower GPU with the 12GB unit despite the RTX 4080 branding, and the gaps are sometime huge.

Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper.

The company worked with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to co-develop a new \"4N\" fabrication process that NVIDIA says is up to two times more power efficient than the 8nm process it used for its 30 Series cards.  Ray tracing performance is significantly improved thanks to Ada Lovelace featuring NVIDIA's new third-generation RT Cores, and the inclusion of a new rendering technique called Shader Execution Reordering and DLSS 3.0.

Our full benchmark results won’t be posted until our final RTX 4080 review launches in the next day or two—a burst pipe in the middle of the night foiled my release-day ambitions—but at a high level, it’s about 30 percent faster than the RTX 3080 at 4K resolution with settings maxed out and ray tracing/DLSS off.

In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised \"integrity, professionalism and accountability,\" and said that \"we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope.\"[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said that Truss \"was not wrong\" to want to improve growth, but admitted that \"some mistakes were made\", and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them.

The process was largely a formality, to make official the results of an internal power struggle in one of Britain's main political parties. Johnson's three-year tenure was peppered with scandals, which eventually resulted in his ouster. So, who is the woman the Conservative Party has chosen to replace him? Like Johnson, 47-year-old Truss is a member of Britain's Conservative party. She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.  She takes over the premiership as the country faces that, and a number of other significant challenges, including sky-rocketing energy prices driven by the war in Ukraine.", "[172] She said she would cancel a planned rise in corporation tax and reverse the recent increase in National Insurance rates, funded by delaying the date by which the national debt is planned to fall, as part of a \"long-term plan to bring down the size of the state and the tax burden\".[173]  On 20 July, Truss and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak were chosen by Conservative Party MPs to be put forward to the membership for the final leadership vote. She finished second in the final MPs ballot, receiving 113 votes to Sunak's 137 votes.[174][175] In the membership vote, it was announced on 5 September that 57.4% of ballots were for Truss, making her the new leader.[175]  As the elected Leader of the Conservative Party, the majority party in the House of Commons, Truss was appointed the new prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle on 6 September 2022.[176]  Truss began appointing her cabinet and to other government positions on 6 September 2022.[177] With the appointment of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor of the Exchequer, James Cleverly as foreign secretary, and Suella Braverman as home secretary, for the first time in British political history, no white men held positions in the Great Offices of State.[178]", "Watch CBS News              By Haley Ott             Updated on:  October 25, 2022 / 7:49 AM           / CBS News          London — Rishi Sunak became prime minister of the United Kingdom on Tuesday after meeting with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace. The 42-year-old former treasury chief is the country's third premier in under two months, the youngest leader since 1812, and the first person of color to serve in the role. He is of Indian heritage and Hindu faith. \"Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers.

The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month – almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level. Similar to the unpredictable ad experience, the available titles on the Basic tier seems extremely scattered without a rhyme or reason.", "Does streaming giant Netflix really deliver something for everyone?

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription … as long as they’re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback. The plan is called Basic With Ads, and the $6.99 figure is much more aligned with consumer expectations compared with the bloated premium $20 subscription — which I discovered I was still somehow paying for over the course of reporting this story. Swapping for the budget option was a no-brainer.", "Jump to        With a vast library of TV shows, movies, and original programming, most people would agree that Netflix is an essential part of the entertainment landscape and easily one of the best streaming services you can sign up for. Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September — an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month. To help you decide which Netflix plan is right you, we've put together a guide detailing how much Netflix charges for each of its membership tiers. Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium, starting at $7 a month and ending at $20 a month. It will cost more to add another user to a subscription plan.", "99 per month, while the same plan without ads costs $9.99. The Standard plan costs $15.49 per month – $8.50 more than the cheapest plan currently available. There’s also the Premium plan, which costs $19.99 per month, pushing subscribers into a tier $13 more expensive than the cheapest one. Netflix’s Basic plan only allows streaming on a single device in 720p resolution. The Standard plan works with two devices simultaneously at 1080p resolution, while the Premium plan enables up to four devices simultaneously at 4K resolution. It’s uncertain at this point whether Netflix plans to discontinue the ad-free basic tier. When Netflix introduced its Basic plan with ads, the company also revealed that the new cheaper plan wouldn’t be available for Apple TV users. More than a month later, the situation is the same.

The second season, which aired weekly at the end of 2022, helped Jennifer Coolidge to secure her first ever Golden Globe, for Best Supporting Performance in a Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film, after being nominated for the same award for the first season.

With a whole new star-studded cast (except Coolidge, who reprised her role as Tanya), season 2 saw a new sun-soaked setting, and a new series of (unfortunate?) events.

We can indulge at a distance, add the dream getaway to the Pinterest board, or maybe even plan a budget-friendly trip of our own.

Let me tell you.  Exteriors were filmed in Taormina, Palermo, Noto, and the neighboring Ionian Sea. This area of Italy has an active volcano, Mount Etna—which we saw in the finale—and many local wineries. There’s a gorgeous castle you can tour called the Palazzo Conte Federico. There’s also, I’m sure you can imagine, so much good food to eat…even though the White Lotus guests ate at the hotel, with a few notable exceptions.

Ironically, Season 1 was filmed amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the tourism industry had been facing many setbacks. This gave production designer Laura Fox the opportunity to spend time redesigning the artwork, sets, and scenery in each room featured in the series; The White Lotus fans have enjoyed analyzing the background details for hidden Easter eggs, and Fox herself compared the subtle menace of the hotel to The Shining. Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina, and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, “Arrivederci.” Considering that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series was filmed in a location with a complex history.", "By Luciana Bellini   Travel  |  22nd December 2022  Jennifer Coolidge reprises her role as the hapless Tanya in The White Lotus season 2, alongside her new husband Greg (played by Jon Gries), but the rest of the cast is filled with new faces, with more than a few you might recognise, including British actor Theo James, Aubrey Plaza of Parks and Recreation fame and the ever-brilliant Tom Hollander.  While season one was filmed exclusively in the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, due to pandemic-related restrictions, for the second season they’ve branched out from the dreamy environs of the hotel to take in some of Sicily’s most beautiful towns and coastal spots, leaving one question on everyone’s lips: just where was The White Lotus filmed? Here’s our guide to all the key filming locations in The White Lotus season 2.  As with the first season, most of the show is centred around the antics of the monied guests staying at an uber luxurious resort – in the first season that was the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, and for the second season the team chose another Four Seasons resort: the grand San Domenico Palace hotel in Taormina. Situated high on the rocks, it offers up splendid views over the Ionian Sea, Mount Etna and an ancient amphitheatre.", "PEOPLE spoke with Executive Producer David Bernad to uncover the details behind this season’s stunning island setting  A fresh set of uber-rich Americans have charted a course to a White Lotus hotel for season two of the HBO hit — and this time they're bringing the drama to the picturesque Italian island of Sicily!   While the appearance of a mysterious dead body may start the season off with a bang, the show's Mediterranean setting — with crystal blue waters, stunning Old World architecture and unique volcanic terrain — is an undeniable highlight.   PEOPLE chatted with Executive Producer David Bernad to unveil all the secrets behind this season's location, including the unexpected role played by Mount Etna, the island's active volcano.   Etna served as a \"visual thematic in a lot of locations,\" Bernad tells PEOPLE, noting that the volcano actually erupted during production. It covered the sky with ash for 24 hours and the crew hurried to capture some mesmerizing footage of the lava rolling slowly down the mountain. The clips made it into the final show as a visual metaphor for the slow-simmering tensions between the characters.   Along with being able to explore the island's volcano (when it's not erupting, of course), fans of the series can also visit the exact locations that The White Lotus called home for season two, from the real Four Seasons hotel that stood in for the titular one, to the characters' favorite winery and bar."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies).

Naomi’s now-husband also wore the designer, with the groom opting for a navy three-piece Ralph Lauren suit. Nearly two years ago, President Biden also wore a single-breasted navy suit by Ralph Lauren to his inauguration ceremony. Naomi and Neal, who met through a mutual friend, announced their engagement in September 2021. In April, the lawyer tweeted that she would be celebrating her November nuptials at the historic Washington, DC, residence, and thanked her grandparents for the opportunity. “Peter and I are endlessly grateful to my Nana and Pop for the opportunity to celebrate our wedding at the White House,” she tweeted at the time. “We can’t wait to make our commitment to one another official and for what lies ahead.” Three months later, Naomi announced the location of her White House would be on the South Lawn, a decision that both the Secret Service and her pets were supportive of. “So not sure how best to update but was supposed to do so weeks ago… but we have finally figured out where the ceremony will be…and much to the relief of the Secret Service and with the dogs’ endorsement… we’ll be getting married on the South Lawn!” she tweeted, along with a photo of the sprawling White House lawn with the Washington Monument in the background. “Couldn’t be more excited.", "Jill Biden had an outfit change; she wore a Reem Acra teal wool crepe coat and silk chiffon dress for the outdoor ceremony and a gold embroidered seafoam blue dress, also by Acra, and sparkly Jimmy Choo pumps for the reception. The daughter of Hunter Biden paid tribute to the first lady by stitching some of Jill’s 1977 wedding dress into the bodice of her gown. The groom, meanwhile, opted for a navy three-piece Ralph Lauren suit. The festivities were just as decadent as the wardrobe; the newlyweds climbed a ladder to cut their seven-foot wedding cake and served a dessert bar that featured a 20-inch apple pie. And, of course, there was ice cream to satisfy the president’s sweet tooth.", "President Joe Biden's granddaughter turned to iconic American label Ralph Lauren to design her custom wedding dress Brittany Talarico is PEOPLE's Deputy Style Director, where she oversees the brand's digital Style and Beauty coverage.

On 19 November, the 28-year-old attorney married fiancé and fellow lawyer Neal on the South Lawn of the White House, the 19th wedding to be held at the Executive Mansion since 1800. The celebration also marked the first White House wedding with a president’s granddaughter as the bride, and the first one on the South Lawn, according to the White House Historical Association. In a recent Vogue cover story documenting Naomi’s big day, it was revealed the bride made a number of wardrobe changes throughout the evening. Naomi, the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked down the aisle wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved Chantilly lace dress designed by Ralph Lauren. The dress was paired with a cathedral-length silk organza veil, featuring a matching Chantilly lace border. She completed the look with a pair of diamond-encrusted Tiffany & Co platinum earrings, according to CNN. The drop earrings reportedly contain South Sea pearls, which are listed for $9,300 per pair on the Tiffany website.", "For the black-tie reception, Naomi changed into a strapless ivory silk Mikado Reem Acra dress, which had her grandmother Roberta Buhle’s pearls sewn into the six-foot train. It wasn’t the only special touch included in Naomi’s multiple wedding looks, as her Ralph Lauren gown also contained lace from Dr Jill Biden’s own wedding dress, which was stitched into the bodice. The president’s granddaughter then switched into a third dress, a beaded fringed Markarian mini-dress, for some late-night dancing, according to Vogue.  According to Noami, the wedding dress she wore to exchange vows with Neal was inspired by the high-necked gown famously worn by actress Grace Kelly when she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. “Like every little girl, I had a vision in my head – it was Grace Kelly’s dress I loved,” she told Vogue. Meanwhile, Jill Biden, who is affectionately referred to as “Nana” by her grandchildren, wore a teal wool crepe coat and silk chiffon dress by Reem Acra for the wedding ceremony, followed by a gold embroidered, seafoam blue dress also by Acra for the reception. According to Vogue, the first lady beamed when she saw her granddaughter in her wedding dress for the first time. “Oh, honey!” she said, as she stretched out her arms for a hug.", "Naomi was so taken with the young law student—who had interned at the Obama White House and worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign—that she texted him the next day while he was on an Amtrak train, headed back to his summer internship in DC, to suggest he disembark in Wilmington and come visit her at her grandparents’ instead. “He did it,” says Naomi with a hint of triumph. (Peter’s taxi driver was impressed when he gave him the address: “That’s Joe Biden’s house!”)  Three years later, Peter proposed in his hometown of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with an emerald-cut diamond fitted on his grandmother’s gold band, even as Naomi’s family assembled as a surprise at his family home.  At the White House, as a magnificent sunset outlines the Washington Monument in shades of lavender and pink, Naomi’s two little sisters, Finnegan, 22, and Maisy, 21, shuffle into the Blue Room where everyone is oohing over the cloudscape.

What country has the best odds to go the distance? Which player will be the breakout star of the tournament? Who will win the Golden Boot? What about the Golden Ball? Will there be a “Hand of God”-like on-field controversy that defines the tournament for years to come? Why do we watch this stupid sport — which always seems to break our hearts — anyway?  But perhaps the most interesting (if often futile!) question of all is: Which group is the tournament’s Group of Death? It’s a fun question, one that has the ability to drum up plenty of controversy (and make some wonder if the Group of Death is actually just a myth). But if you’re looking for clear answers, you probably won’t find any this time around.   Is it Group B — featuring England, Iran, the U.S. and Wales — which has the highest average world ranking as defined by FIFA?

Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments. With five billion people expected to tune in to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the pressure to get it right is on. The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted.  FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed.

That said, their 2021 Nations League run — where La Roja were only beaten in the final by France — is another good sign.

MORE WORLD CUP 2022:", "Does your team have an easy ride or are they facing this year’s group of death? Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments. With five billion people expected to tune in to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the pressure to get it right is on. The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted.  FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed. Group E, with Spain and Germany, looks sewn up from the start, as does Group F, with Belgium and Croatia. But anything could happen in the other groups.", "MORE: Spain's final 26-man squad for the World Cup Germany failed to make amends for a nightmare showing when they attempted to defend their 2014 title in 2018 only to suffer elimination in the group stage.  They took the field in Qatar with Hansi Flick at the helm. He replaced long-time coach Joachim Low who enjoyed many successful runs with the national team. The highlight of that era came as Germany lifted a fourth world title at Brazil 2014 and, after a disappointing European Championship campaign in 2021 marked Low’s farewell last year, Low's former assistant, Hansi Flick, is leading an exciting new generation keen to make amends.

Only in the very dying seconds did you find yourself wondering whether Spain might be prepared to accept the defeat that ensured they and Japan knocked Germany out. Just before then, however, they had crafted an opening for Olmo and seemed to finally be poking holes in the defense. Considering Luis Enrique was unaware his side had, for a few seconds at least, been bound for the exit door, it is hard to be certain that they were entirely aware of events 30 miles away. Equally, come Friday morning they may feel a degree of thankfulness to Doan and Tanaka for firing them to the other side of the bracket. Resolute Morocco may well be a tougher test than an ageing Croatia might have been but beyond that the likes of Portugal, Serbia or Switzerland would make for nowhere near as intimidating a quarter final opponent as Brazil, a matchup with whom seemed inevitable on matchday one.

The ideal scenario for Germany would have been a loss for Japan vs Spain, which would see them advance if they won against Costa Rica. A draw between Spain and Japan would mean goal difference would come into play to decide who among Germany and Japan would advance as the second-placed team from the group behind Spain. In case of a Japan win, both Germany and Spain would be tied on four points but the Spanish team would hold the outright advantage since their goal difference heading into the final group game was +7 while Germany’s was -1. Only a huge win for Germany or a huge loss for Spain, or a combination of both, could offset the difference. So, regardless of other results, a big win over Costa Rica was the need of the hour for Germany. With both matches kicking off simultaneously, things started well for the Germans as they took an early lead against Costa Rica at Al Bayt Stadium, courtesy a Serge Gnabry strike. Favourable tidings followed shortly from the Khalifa International Stadium, where Spain had taken the lead through Alvaro Morata - one of the joint top scorers in FIFA World Cup 2022. Things, however, took a sharp turn after half-time.", "Against USA's closed defense, an offensive attitude with creativity in midfield could be the key to success. Memphis Depay is fit again and is expected to start as one of the two strikers. The question is whether Van Gaal chooses Steven Bergwijn as a second striker and uses Gakpo as attacking midfielder, or uses Gakpo as that second striker just like he did against Qatar. If Van Gaal takes the latter approach, Steven Berghuis and Davy Klaassen could provide an offensive impulse in midfield, leaving De Jong free to create and pick his passes. The fitness of the teams is also an important factor. Van Gaal indicated previously that his team is fit just in time for the knockout phase, having been able to rest some key players against Qatar. Meanwhile, the US are coming off a grueling game against Iran, in which Pulisic hobbled off with a \"pelvic contusion\" -- he's day-to-day in terms of being ready for Saturday -- and most of US coach Gregg Berhalter's best players put in heavy work. The Netherlands must deal with this smartly and let the opponent tire out; that way, they can make a difference later in the game if needed. -- Ligthart US 1, Netherlands 1: US advance on penalties. The Dutch have the better talent and the better history, but at no point in the group stage did they appear like a team gearing up for a deep run.", "But Son's clever play set up Hwang's winner, and he delivered when his teammates needed him the most. Over at Group G, Brazil had already clinched a spot in the round of 16 but were aiming to finish the only team in the entire tournament to win all three group stage games. Still playing without injured Neymar, the Brazilians couldn't muster much against a Cameroon side looking to keep their hopes alive. A 92nd-minute goal by Vincent Aboubakar (who was then sent off for taking his shirt off in celebration) gave the African side a small chance, but Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia in the concurrent match ensured the Swiss would advance. Brazil lost their first group stage match since 1998, and with no teams winning the maximum nine points for the first time since 1994, it's a fitting way to end what's been a wild start to the World Cup. USA fans, get your beauty sleep as you have an early date against the vaunted Netherlands, with the winner of Saturday morning's matchup going on to face either Argentina or Australia. Good news for US fans as Christian Pulisic is now cleared to play against the Dutch. As you recall, Pulisic taught us what a \"pelvic contusion\" is after he collided with the Iran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand as he scored Tuesday's game-winning goal that sent the USMNT into the round of 16.", "Uruguay had a similar exit after drawing with South Korea to open the tournament, failing to advance even after besting Ghana 2-0 in its final game. Netherlands v. USA (Saturday, Dec. 3, 10:00 a.m. ET): The Netherlands' squad cruised to advancement in a relatively easy group. Dutch forward Cody Gakpo is the standout for his team with a goal in each of the three group games, making him one of the top scorers in the World Cup so far. The U.S. has the goods on defense – it didn't allow a single goal in the run of play during the group stage – so, instead, its challenge will be scoring. The Americans have managed just two goals so far, and Christian Pulisic was involved in both. Pulisic has been cleared to play Saturday after his injury versus Iran, but whether he's truly at 100% could be the determining factor for the U.S. Argentina v. Australia (Saturday, Dec. 3, 2:00 p.m. ET): The expectations for Argentina were sky-high as it came into what's likely to be Messi's final World Cup. The team stumbled early with a historic upset loss to Saudi Arabia – maybe the biggest upset in the tournament's history – but has since righted the ship with 2-0 victories over both Mexico and Poland.", "The United States men's national team has advanced to the World Cup knockout stage for the first time since 2014 after beating Iran 1-0 at Al Thumama Stadium on Tuesday.

I think ultimately it is a conversation we’re having about ourselves, but it’s easy to put it on Barbie.” Robbie along with her Ken, Ryan Gosling, and I were speaking in Beverly Hills a few weeks before the film opens on July 21, a date that has turned into a gender battle at the box office between “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical drama about the making of the atomic bomb, “Oppenheimer.” That hasn’t stopped Robbie and Gosling from vibrating with excitement over what they’ve created and the deep understanding their writer-director Greta Gerwig had for the material. (Gerwig co-wrote the script with her partner, Noah Baumbach.) Gosling compared her work to Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can: “It’s like showing you this thing that you’ve seen a million times as art,” he said. “Once I read the script, I felt like I was seeing all these things that were around me in a completely new and deep and hilarious way.” Gerwig in an email likened her stars to “top-flight race cars just hanging out and sometimes racing, but just for fun,” and added “I think they were both just delighted by the other.” In our conversation Robbie and Gosling spoke about Friday-night script readings with Mattel executives, how Ken is regarded in the Gosling household and leaning in to the thorny aspects of Barbie.

Just ask 42-year-old Ryan Gosling, who, after landing the role of Ken in the new Barbie movie, has faced claims he is too “ancient” to play the doll. The internet is already obsessed with the first live-action Barbie movie, thanks to trailers released ahead of the Warner Bros. film’s debut next month. (The Washington Post has previously described the trailers as “fever-dream-like.”) But the promotional material has already prompted some critics to use the hashtag #NotMyKen to express their disappointment in Gosling’s casting, writing on social media that he is too old to play the part of the chiseled doll with perfect hair. “I can’t be the only one that thinks Ryan gosling looks old to play Ken,” read one of many tweets questioning the star’s age. “Ryan Gosling looks old and washed out in this to me. I think it’d have made more sense with someone younger at this point,” read another, while a third said: “that’s so sad that man is ancient.” Gosling responded to the criticism Wednesday in an interview with GQ magazine, saying: “If people don’t want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with.” He also joked that for decades nobody has ever particularly cared about Ken, who is really known only as Barbie’s boyfriend and the guy who works at the beach. “It is funny ...", "this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken. Like you ever thought about Ken before this?” Technically, Ken has no official age (he is a doll, after all) although he was first introduced as Barbie’s boyfriend on March 11, 1961, which means he has been around for 62 years. (Barbie was created in 1959, which would make her 64.) But experts say the backlash Gosling faced also highlights that ageism, something that female actors frequently face, impacts men in the industry, too — and that stars playing iconic Barbie characters may have particularly tough expectations to live up to. Why we can’t look away from the ‘Barbie’ movie’s fever-dream-like trailer “It’s interesting to see this conversation happening” over Ryan Gosling, Dennis Olsen, associate professor of advertising and branding at London School of Film, Media and Design, said in an interview. The issue of age has been an “ongoing conversation” centered around women for a long time, and “fresh faces are regularly required by some studios and producers in order to, what they assume, ensure desirability,” he said. “Age impacts both men and women in different ways.", "\"I was also going to do a specialty cameo with Timmy, and both of them couldn't do it and I was so annoyed. But I love them so much.\" She continued, \"But it felt like doing something without my children. I mean, I'm not their mom, but I sort of feel like their mom.\" The live-action movie will center around the Mattel fashion doll, but with a twist — the movie's unofficial IMDb reads, \"A doll living in 'Barbie Land' is expelled for not being perfect enough and sets off on an adventure in the real world.\"   The Barbie doll has received criticism in the past for her biologically-impossible figure setting unachievable body standards, so it'll be interesting to see the direction that Greta Gerwig takes. Margot Robbie told British Vogue that she's aware that the Barbie character \"comes with a lot of baggage. And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that comes a lot of exciting ways to attack it.\"   The film is scheduled to hit theaters on July 21, 2023, a date that's anticipated by kids and adults alike.

While it’s a shame that Campbell didn’t return due to an inadequate salary offer, it was time to let Sidney ride off into the sunset and release her from Ghostface-chasing duty.

This is a grimier entry, more likely to break with convention — one where the white mask of its serial killer Ghostface is scuffed up. The character’s physicality is also steadier, more willing to be still, with the occasional Michael Myers head tilt. Moving from the well-appointed and brightly lit homes of small towns and the suburbs to the dark alleys of New York sounded like a desperate move (see “Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan”), but placing stalker sequences in crowds inspired some fresh thinking. There are a couple of truly frightening, patiently established suspense scenes, including one inside a subway car during Halloween that’s filled with people in costumes of horror villains, including multiple Ghostfaces. It’s a nicely staged vignette that, in keeping with the spirit of “Scream,” operates as a meta commentary on the glut of scary movies.

Gunn posted a statement on Instagram reading, \"Disrespectful outcry will never, ever affect our actions\" regarding the company's upcoming movie slate — to which Levi commented, \"Amen. 🙏.\"", "Luckily, it seems that Lucy Liu will get to do a lot more in the upcoming Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Kalypso is rumored to be a supervillain, and her character appears to be quite powerful. Her Greek counterpart didn't necessarily have any powers aside from running a loving home, but early set photos suggest that this version will most certainly have superhuman abilities. Kalypso is wearing battle-worn armor, and behind-the-scenes photos suggest she'll be carrying an impressive weapon. It's not clear yet what her goals will be, but it does appear that she'll be working alongside her sister throughout the film. Yes, Hespera is Kalypso's sister in the movie. Related: Shazam! Fury of the Gods Director Celebrates Release Date Change That's right: Dame Helen Mirren will be portraying Hespera, another daughter of Atlas. Like her sister, Hespera has no counterpart in the DC Universe. She's loosely derived from the Hesperides, who are sometimes referred to as the Nymphs of the West or the Daughters of the Evening. These are all collective names for a group of Atlas' daughters, and mythology tells us that there may have been anywhere between three and seven of them. The maidens were named for the colors of the sunset and tasked with protecting golden apples beyond the Ocean.", "When we got done filming, I walked over to Zachary and said ‘You really are the best Captain Marvel!’” Gray has fond memories of making the original series, and has truly enjoyed his interactions with the fans over the years since it first aired. Shazam! is now available in its fully-remastered glory on both Blu-ray and on HBO Max. “The show was very special because of the moral values in every episode,” Gray recalls. “It was all about teaching kids right from wrong. At Cons these days, fans are continually thanking me for those lessons, and how it was our show that helped them get through hard times as a child. And now they pass on those strong moral values by watching with their kids and grandkids. In my opinion, we need more TV shows and movies like that today.”  Posted at 11:19 PM  | Permalink           Tags:         Billy Batson, comic book, Entertainment, Michael Gray, Shazam!, Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, superhero, TV, Zachary Levi        | Reblog  (0)     You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.  \tThe comments to this entry are closed.

Billy Batson will have his hands full as the kid-turned-adult superhero will square off against a new villain with plans that will likely cause some mayhem. Mirren has been adding a lot more big-budget action films to her already impressive filmography, having starred in The Fate of the Furious, Hobbs & Shaw, the upcoming F9, and in the movie adaptation of DC’s Red and its sequel Red 2.  Shazam! saw Billy Batson and his superhero alter ego dealing with new powers and a villain who wanted to steal Billy’s powers for himself. In Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Billy will be up against a new kind of villain, one who is likely far more formidable foe than Sivana ever was.

The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have.

It looks like Billy Batson may have found a new nemesis to square off against in Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the upcoming sequel to DC’s fun, box office-pleasing 2019 breakout film. Multiple industry sources report that screen icon Helen Mirren (the Fast and Furious franchise) has been tapped — or should we say zapped? — to play a mysterious new character with a potentially villainous role. Mirren is joining the Shazam! sequel as Hespera, the daughter of Atlas, according to The Hollywood Reporter and other sources. Though her role in the movie is being described as villainous, THR additionally notes that Hespera and her Atlas-descended sister (played by Shazam! newcomer Rachel Zegler, who's set to lead Steven Speilberg's West Side Story revival), “may or may not be of ill intent.” Hespera appears to be a new character to the DC movie-verse, with no direct comic book tie-in.

And Zegler, as a 6,000-year-old goddess, brings a disarming innocence to her crush on our boy Freddy. When the script falters, the spirited actors are always there to pick up the slack.

Fury of the Gods” arrives with two strikes against it since it’s not only a studio-produced sequel but also a superhero movie made in 2023. One should expect a certain level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels about the surprisingly decent “Shazam!”. The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including director David F. Sandberg, toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg sentimentality that’s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate the landscape. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” meanders further in that direction. The first “Shazam!” works as well as it does because it’s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. “Shazam!

The period also saw the emergence of hip-hop’s three horsemen – Drake, J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar – who carved their legacies with chart-topping hits and groundbreaking albums throughout the 2010s. Their contributions, as well as those from Future, Big Sean, Travis Scott, and Chance the Rapper, set the stage for the decade.  Read on for 10 of the most consequential releases of the 2010s. Just a year removed from interrupting Taylor Swift on stage during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West, now known as Ye, produced arguably the best rap album of the decade, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.  It was a career turn that’s more familiar to rap fans in recent years, but the Chicago rapper snapped back with a glossy, epic-level album that was a culmination of his best work to that point — or maybe ever. From \"Dark Fantasy\" to \"So Appalled\" and \"Gorgeous,\" West was at the peak of his lyrical powers, with the rapper-producer exchanging sharp-tongued lyrics with wordsmiths like Pusha T, CyHi The Prynce and Raekwon.", "This list of nominees has every flavor of rap within it. Yes, it’s a recurring theme: all the DJ Khaled Grammy love comes as something of a head-scratcher. “GOD DID” is a good song and Hov gave us one of the best verses of the year, but a major nod like this calls for an extra bit of special something that isn’t really there. On just about any list, “Vegas” would reign as the catchiest song of the bunch. The Los Angeles-born Doja Cat has a knack for creating songs that require repeat listens. Regarding “Pushin P,” well, that song deserves every nomination it receives. The record was everywhere at the beginning of the year and it’s proven to have staying power. Again, I’m surprised “The Heart Part 5” would be nominated over “N95” — in the past, Kendrick Lamar’s Grammy nominations have generally gone to some of his biggest radio or streaming hits. Opting for “The Heart Part 5” in this case would be like “The Art of Peer Pressure,” “Mortal Man,” or “Duckworth” getting a similar nod over more commercially impactful cuts. Easily the most shocking rap nomination of them all. I thought this record was merely an anthem in the streets and on social media.

Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord server, by direct messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third party server. To generate images, users use the /imagine command and type in a prompt; the bot then returns a set of four images. Users may then choose which images they want to upscale. Midjourney is also working on a web interface.[17]  Founder David Holz says he sees artists as customers, not competitors of Midjourney. Holz told The Register that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves.[5] Some artists have accused Midjourney of devaluing original creative work by using it in the training set;[18] Midjourney's terms of service includes a DMCA takedown policy, allowing artists to request their work to be removed from the set if they believe copyright infringement to be evident.[19]", "Rob Salkowitz, Forbes Contributor: What’s your role and title? David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is Midjourney’s mission?  We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that it’s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this text-to-image technology for business and society? I’m definitely more concerned about society than business. We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not.

The tool's founder David Holz answered this question in a recent interview with The Verge, talking about Midjourney's art style, copyright issues, and what AI is. Midjourney creators see their tool \"as an engine for the imagination,\" \"a very positive and humanistic thing.\" Holz answered the most popular question asked by artists when they deal with such technology: won't AI replace human art one day? \"What does it mean when computers are better at visual imagination than 99 percent of humans? That doesn’t mean we will stop imagining. Cars are faster than humans, but that doesn’t mean we stopped walking. When we’re moving huge amounts of stuff over huge distances, we need engines, whether that’s airplanes or boats or cars.\" Moreover, Midjourney is a social product with its huge Discord server created because \"people really like imagining together.\" This social aspect, however, could potentially cause problems for the AI due to copyright, and while you can’t copyright AI-generated art, some artists might not be happy about technology taking their unique style to train on.", "Mohammad Emad Mostaque (Bengali: মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক) is the founder and CEO of Stability AI, one of the companies behind Stable Diffusion.", "“We’re going from a Midjourney universe to a Midjourney multiverse,” as Holz puts it.

And, of course, we got Midjourney to illustrate our conversation.  This interview below has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  It’d be great to start with a bit about yourself and Midjourney. What’s your background? How did you get in this scene? And what is Midjourney — a company, a community? How would you describe it? So, my name is David Holz, and I guess I’m a serial entrepreneur. My brief history would be: I had a design business in high school. I went to college for physics in maths. I was working on a PhD in fluid mechanics while working at NASA and Max Planck. I got overwhelmed at one point and put all those things aside.

In this article, we’ll explore the history of Midjourney, its impact on image creation, and how this technology promises to change the industry forever.  David Holz, known for co-founding Leap Motion, a company specializing in 3D motion detection technology, founded Midjourney to bring an innovative solution to image creation. The company was founded with the goal of leveraging AI to generate realistic, detailed and engaging images in a variety of fields ranging from art to advertising.  Midjourney uses deep learning algorithms to create AI-generated images. These algorithms are trained on thousands of existing images, allowing them to learn to reproduce different styles, textures and elements. Once training is complete, the algorithms can generate new images by combining the knowledge gained during training.  AI-generated images have tremendous potential in a variety of fields, and Midjourney is at the forefront of these applications. Here are some of the areas where the images generated by Midjourney can be used:  Midjourney promises to revolutionize image creation by offering a faster, cheaper and more creative alternative to traditional methods.

That initial pop may have been a sigh of relief from some investors, who’ve watched Pinterest’s stock steadily decline over the last year. Or, perhaps it’s a vote of confidence for Pinterest’s incoming chief executive: Google commerce boss Bill Ready.  In 2021, Pinterest announced a goal to steeply increase the number of women among its leadership ranks.

Earlier, Ready roamed PayPal’s halls as its chief operating officer, and before that, he ran Braintree (which PayPal snapped up in 2013 for $800 million).

The media executive inherits a slew of challenges as she begins leading the company. In the roughly seven months since Musk bought and began running the social media company, it has faced various challenges—including figuring out how to monetize its blue-check offering, and an exodus of advertisers amid concerns about hate speech on the site—all while Musk slashed staff numbers. “It’s been a cascading set of events that have really put her behind the eight ball in terms of favorable conditions,” says Brian Uzzi, a professor of leadership at Northwestern University.  Yaccarino, who has spent nearly 12 years as an advertising executive at NBCUniversal, is faced with the task of rehabilitating Twitter in more ways than one—most notably repairing the company’s reputation with advertisers and bringing it to profitability.  Here are some of the biggest challenges Yaccarino faces as Twitter’s new CEO.

While it feels a bit weird typing these words, more than anything, I’m excited because tomorrow our new CEO will be Bill Ready. I want to share how I came to this decision.    One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine.  I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out. Over months of conversations and dinners, he impressed me with his insights, experience and values. Bill understands deep down that Pinterest is still early in its story.

Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a new CEO for Twitter, or X Corp. as it’s now called — and it’s a woman. He did not name her but said she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.” (May 11) Elon Musk confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal’s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with deep ties to the advertising industry.  “I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!” Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino “will focus primarily on business operations” while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships.  Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which is now called X Corp.  Few expect Musk to remove himself from the decision making process at Twitter, however.  “While he’s stepping back from the CEO title, Musk is far from likely to step back from calling the product shots,” said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research.", "Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            During his six months as Twitter’s CEO and owner, Elon Musk decimated its ad business, alienated some news publications and VIP users, and plunged the platform into a constant state of chaos.             Now, a new chief executive will be tasked with trying to turn things around.             Musk announced on Friday that he would in the coming weeks hand the CEO role over to Linda Yaccarino, a longtime media executive and former chairman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. Yaccarino has said little publicly so far, beyond noting her excitement to “transform this business together.”             Twitter is in desperate need of stability from a leader. And Yaccarino brings the ad industry chops that Twitter sorely needs to lure back top advertisers and boost its business after a turbulent period. But she may struggle to address Twitter’s biggest problem: Elon Musk.             Although Musk is handing off the CEO title — and, perhaps, trying to shed some of the accountability that comes with it — the billionaire remains firmly in charge of the company as its owner and executive chair. Musk will still be in the C-Suite as Twitter’s chief technology officer.

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker.

Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

But this could be one of those years in which one film dominates the night. If you’re looking for an overarching theme from tonight’s Academy Awards, Jamie Lee Curtis’ best supporting actress win portends a big one: This is already gearing up to be an enormous night for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Curtis’ win — against, among others, co-star Stephanie Hsu, with whom she was splitting votes — suggests a deep well of support for the film, which was already leading the Oscars field with 11 nominations.

It’s the third Oscar for del Toro, who won twice for The Shape of Water in 2018.

Thank you to the storytellers here who did that for me.” Other nominees in the category included “All Quiet on the Western Front,” “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “The Banshees of Inisherin,” “Elvis,” “The Fabelmans,” “Tár,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Triangle of Sadness” and “Women Talking.” Brendan Fraser won the Academy Award for best actor for his performance in \"The Whale.\" Fraser, appearing visibly shocked and emotional upon accepting his trophy, began by thanking the film's director Darren Aronofsky for throwing him \"a creative lifetime and hauling me aboard the good ship 'The Whale.'\" Reflecting on his journey in the entertainment industry, which started 30 years ago, he added, \"Things -- they didn't come easily to me, but there was a facility that I didn't appreciate at the time until it stopped.\" Other actors nominated in the category included Austin Butler for his performance in \"Elvis,\" Colin Farrell for his performance in \"The Banshees of Inisherin,\" Paul Mescal for his performance in \"Aftersun\" and Bill Nighy for his performance in \"Living.\" All were first-time Oscar nominees.", "This shutout for Black performers hasn’t happened since 2020 when the South Korean film Parasite won many key categories, and Cynthia Erivo was the only Black performer nominated. It’s a sad reminder that the Oscars remain a space that often makes room for one non-white group among winners in its top categories, often represented by one successful film.  By Glen Weldon Harrison Ford presented the best picture award — a canny move by the evening’s producers, who were clearly betting on an Everything Everywhere All at Once win, as it would reunite Ford and Quan, who starred together in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 39 years ago. The two shared a warm embrace. The fantasy film about motherhood, love, googly eyes and the multiverse took home the Academy Award for best picture. The film, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert — who’d picked up Oscars for original screenplay and directing earlier in the evening — was widely favored to win best picture. But the evening began with All Quiet on the Western Front racking up several Oscar statuettes, causing some to wonder if it might be the German war film’s night.

By Gabe Cohn The 95th Academy Awards were held Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the proudly weird sci-fi movie from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, swept most of the top categories, including best picture and directing. Michelle Yeoh, that movie’s star, won the best actress award, becoming the first Asian actress ever to win that honor. The other lead acting prize went to Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”), also a first-time winner. (Perhaps the biggest winner of all: A24, the studio behind both of those movies.) Earlier victories went to “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won for best animated feature; Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, each first-time winners for supporting roles in “Everything Everywhere All at Once”; “Navalny,” which picked up the best documentary feature statuette; the costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who became the first Black woman to have won two Oscars (this time for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”); “All Quiet on the Western Front,” which won several awards in the first half of the show, including for best international feature, production design and cinematography; and Sarah Polley, who won the best adapted screenplay honor for “Women Talking.” See below for a full list of winners.", "Lead-actress nominee Michelle Yeoh is up against Tár powerhouse Cate Blanchett, among others, and the film’s directors, Daniels, are up against the likes of Steven Spielberg. But this could be one of those years in which one film dominates the night. If you’re looking for an overarching theme from tonight’s Academy Awards, Jamie Lee Curtis’ best supporting actress win portends a big one: This is already gearing up to be an enormous night for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Curtis’ win — against, among others, co-star Stephanie Hsu, with whom she was splitting votes — suggests a deep well of support for the film, which was already leading the Oscars field with 11 nominations.  By Stephen Thompson Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, an ambitious stop-motion retelling of the classic children’s story, won best animated feature at Sunday’s Academy Awards. It’s the third Oscar for del Toro, who won twice for The Shape of Water in 2018. The film, which expands on the classic story to include deeper references to grief and fascism, had performed well across this awards season and bested a field rounded out by Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, The Sea Beast and Turning Red."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Sept 23 (Reuters) - Burberry (BRBY.L) finance chief Julie Brown will step down in April after more than five years in the role, the latest change of guard at the British luxury brand as it struggles to keep up with rivals. The 60-year-old British national, who joined the company in 2017 from medical products maker Smith & Nephew (SN.L), will also leave her role as chief operating officer and will take up an opportunity in a different industry, Burberry said on Friday.

More C-suite changes are expected: rumours have been circulating that Akeroyd is seeking a new chief creative officer to replace Riccardo Tisci, whose contract is due to expire in early 2023. Still, analysts were surprised by Brown’s exit. “While not an industry insider, Julie has definitely the merit of having promoted an unswerving focus on cost efficiency,” says Luca Solca, senior analyst at consultancy Bernstein, in a note. “This departure adds to the ‘to do’ list of Jonathan Akeroyd, as media reports indicate he is trying to recruit a new creative director as well. We think new and more original creative energy could benefit Burberry. The CFO departure at this point seems an outright setback, though.” Flavio Cereda, MD and analyst at financial services company Jeffries, writes: “No reasons have been disclosed for her decision to exit the group she joined six years ago, but it implies a further clean slate for new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd ahead of his strategic presentation (relaunch) in November.” “Julie has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth, supported by a high-quality team,” a statement from Akeroyd reads.

This is my favorite fact now.  Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.  He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the entire plan back.", "For the second time in six years, Hasbro has gone to the Microsoft well to find a new executive to run Wizards of the Coast.  Hasbro has hired Microsoft executive Cynthia Williams as President of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, taking over when current WotC CEO Chris Cocks ascends to become CEO of Hasbro on February 25 (see \"Wizards of the Coast President To Run Hasbro\"), the company announced.  Cocks came to his Wizards of the Coast CEO role from Microsoft in 2016 (see \"WotC CEO Replaced by Microsoft Exec”).

You don’t have to worry about trying to parse which photos are cleaned up with Magic Editor just yet: Google says the feature will be coming later this year.

The Verge is a vox media network © 2023 Vox Media, LLC.", "There have long been discussions about how far a photo can be edited before it’s no longer a photo, and Google’s tools push us closer to a world where we tap on every image to perfect it, reality or not. Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-“enhanced” photos with “Space Zoom,” a feature that’s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren’t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a “fake” image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it’s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new. But Google’s Magic Editor could make a more substantial form of fakery easier and more attractive.", "And surely improvements will be made to its capabilities prior to a prime-time launch, which likely won't be until later this year or even 2024. Want to get your hands on the Magic Editor sooner rather than later? As of writing, it isn’t available to the public. But worry not, Google says it’ll 'give select Pixel phones early access to Magic Editor later this year.' Who exactly will get access and when, we can’t say. So be sure to keep an eye on Google’s blog for additional updates. I think a lot of the resentment directed at A.I. is because it makes tasks that used to take effort and skill almost effortless.  But that's technology.  The time and effort invested in learning a skill, tossed out the window.  In time, it won't even be necessary to learn to drive (a step many people skip, anyway).   But after automated focus, exposure and composition, what next?  A.I. lawyers suing other A.I. lawyers, A.I. doctors, A.I. CEOs and eventually, in the far distant future, the ability to accurately select brown hair in front of a brown wall. Good photography needs no manipulation.

Each of us seeks to do work that gives us purpose — to write a great novel, to make a discovery, to build strong communities, to care for the sick. The urge to connect to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time consumed by the drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy. To reconnect to the soul of our work, we don’t just need a better way of doing the same things. We need a whole new way to work. Today, we are bringing the power of next-generation AI to work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot — your copilot for work. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet. “Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.", "By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Microsoft is announcing a new AI-powered Copilot for its Microsoft 365 apps and services today, designed to assist people with generating documents, emails, presentations, and much more. The Copilot, powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft’s Copilot leaked earlier today. “It works alongside you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more,” said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. “Copilot is a whole new way of working.” Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can also be summoned throughout Microsoft’s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on other files. The AI-generated text can then be freely edited and adapted.", "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It’s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents — and potentially, the meaning — of a photo in much more significant ways. While it’s clear that this tool isn’t flawless — and there remains no firm release date for it — Google’s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.", "While Microsoft is certainly moving quickly with its AI-powered vision for Office apps, there will certainly be concerns around this speed of innovation and the accuracy of its AI models, particularly when Microsoft 365 users may well be using them with business data in the months ahead.  “We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise,” says Spataro in a blog post today, noting the company’s AI principles. Microsoft recently laid off its ethics and society team within the artificial intelligence organization. The team had been working to identify risks posed by Microsoft’s adoption of OpenAI’s language models throughout its software and services. That’s left some inside and outside Microsoft concerned at the pace of AI-powered software, but Spataro doesn’t share the same concerns. “To serve the unmet needs of our customers, we must move quickly and responsibly, learning as we go,” says Spataro. “ We’re testing Copilot with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale, and we will expand to more soon.” Microsoft is clearly starting small to ensure any costly mistakes are discovered early on. “When the system gets things wrong, or has biases, or is misused, we have mitigations in place,” says Jamie Teevan, Microsoft’s chief scientist. “We’re tackling the long term implications and novel risks like jailbreaks.", "In its blog post explaining the tool, Google makes it seem like we’re all in search of perfection, noting that the Magic Editor will provide “more control over the final look and feel of your photo” while getting the chance to fix a missed opportunity that would make a photo look its best. Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I’m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event. If I was taking a picture of a wedding and the sky was cloudy, I wouldn’t think about swapping it for something better. Maybe — just maybe — I might consider moving things around or amping up the sky on a picture I’m posting to social media, but even that seems a little disingenuous. But, again, that’s just me. I could still see plenty of people using the Magic Editor to perfect their photos for social media, which adds to the larger conversation of what exactly we should consider a photo and whether or not that’s something people should be obligated to disclose. Google calls its Magic Editor “experimental technology” that will become available to “select” Pixel phones later this year before rolling out to everyone else. If Google is already adding AI-powered image editing tools to Photos, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before smartphone makers integrate these one-tap tools, like sky replacement or the ability to move a subject, directly into a phone’s camera software.", "For example, let’s say your company had an important meeting, but you were too busy to attend. Copilot lets you jump to the important parts and read the gist of each discussion. This allows you to get started and back to work quickly. Microsoft 365 Copilot also collects data from various documents, notes, contacts, emails and appointments. Consequently, you can summarize chats, find important dates, draft emails or write instant plans based on numerous project files. For example, you can ask Microsoft Copilot to create an email summary of your previous meeting. It would use related data from other MS apps to compose your message.

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’ libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated.", "May 12, 2023 ...

Today at I/O, we gave a sneak peek of Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you reimagine your photos and make editing even easier. With Magic Editor, you’ll be able to make complex edits without pro-level editing skills. Using a combination of AI techniques, including generative AI, it will help you make edits to specific parts of an image — like the subject, sky or background — so you have even more control over the final look and feel of your photo. Sometimes the difference between a so-so picture and the perfect shot comes down to getting the framing just right. Magic Editor will help you improve the overall composition of your photo by allowing you to reposition the subject of your shot to the best spot. For example, if you’re trying to get the perfect photo from your time at a popular waterfall, you could remove the bag strap you forgot to take off.

The company revealed the feature at Google I/O 2023. Google shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo, erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo, which generates “new” parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It’s impressive stuff — and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser.

Spataro was quick to note that Copilot won’t always be correct, though. “Sometimes Copilot will get it right, other times it will be usefully wrong, giving you an idea that’s not perfect but still gives you a head start,” said Spataro during Microsoft’s AI event today. Copilot will also exist in Outlook, so you can spend less time deleting emails and responding.

That includes the ability to enhance the sky, move and scale subjects, as well as remove parts of an image with just a few taps. Google’s Magic Editor attempts to package all the steps that it would take to make similar edits in a program like Photoshop into a single tap — or, at least, that’s what it looks like from the demo. In Photoshop, for example, you’re stuck using the Content-Aware Move tool (or any of the other methods of your choice) to pick up and move a subject inside of an image. Even then, the photo still might not look quite right, which means you’ll have to pick up other tools, like the Clone Stamp tool or maybe even the Spot Healing Brush, to fix any leftover artifacts or a mismatched background. It’s not the most complicated process ever, but as with most professional creative tools, there’s a definite learning curve for people who are new to the program. I’m all for Google making photo editing tools free and more accessible, given that Photoshop and some of the other image editing apps out there are expensive and pretty unintuitive.

They can withdraw their names later if they decide they’re not quite ready to go pro, though if college players want to maintain their NCAA eligibility, they can’t hire an agent who’s not certified by the NCAA. Once the early entrant list is set, NBA teams can begin conducting or attending workouts for those players. May 16-17: NBA G League Elite Camp (tentative) In 2019, the Elite Camp – having recently been revamped by the NBA – consisted of 40 veteran G League invitees participating in the first half of the event, followed by 40 top draft-eligible players (who weren’t invited to the actual combine) taking part in the second half.

It was Harman's first career major championship and his first PGA Tour win in six years.[3]  The 2023 Open Championship was organized by the R&A, and was included in the PGA Tour, European Tour, and Japan Golf Tour calendars under the major championships category. The tournament was a 72-hole (4 rounds) stroke play competition held over 4 days, with 18 holes played each day. Play was in groups of three for the first two days, and groups of two in the final two days. Groupings for the first two days were decided by the organizers, with each group having one morning and one afternoon tee time.

(AP Photo/Matt York) LOS ANGELES (AP) — In the city of stars, Wyndham Clark had his own script in mind in the U.S. Open. In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf’s biggest talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother — “Play big,” she always told him — and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That’s where Clark delivered clutch saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become a major champion. “I feel like I belong on this stage,” Clark said after closing with an even-par 70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. “Even two, three years ago when people didn’t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.", "Brian Harman won the 151st Open Championship on Sunday, sealing the first major of his career in dominant fashion.

But it was Donald, the defensive lineman, who really turned the game, in the same visceral, powerful way that a hydraulic dam stops a river. That play with Burrow wasn’t the last play of the game, but it was certainly the play that ended it. “One last play to be world champs,” as Donald said. One last play. Forty-three seconds left, the Bengals driving at midfield toward a game-tying field goal that would have forced overtime and Burrow showing the showstopper charisma of Young Elvis. For eight years, Donald had been seeking the moment. Eight years of individual awards — of all-pros and Pro Bowls. Three-time defensive player of the year. He had close to a hundred sacks and all kinds of other statistics. But as Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said, “Stats are for losers, man.” Donald didn’t want any more stats. He wanted the ring, a championship, the one that eluded him three years earlier when the Rams lost to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. “I know what it feels like to be there, but I don’t know what it feels like to win,” Donald said last week.

That came despite the Bengals' best effort to keep Kupp from getting the ball. Before the final touchdown, Kupp drew three straight penalties -- a defensive holding, a defensive pass interference and an unnecessary roughness -- to set up the final score. \"Once we got down in the tight red area, it felt like it was about 60 plays for us to be able to finally get that one in on the fade,\" McVay said. \"And Cooper Kupp is the man.\" Kupp's Super Bowl heroics put the finishing touches on a stellar season in which he cemented himself as one of the league's best players.", "Feb 12, 2023 ...

The Eastern Washington product scored the go-ahead touchdown on a leaping, 1-yard catch on a back-shoulder fade from Matthew Stafford with 1:25 left in the game. Aaron Donald and L.A.’s defense held up, and the Rams took home a 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Kupp finished with eight receptions for 92 receiving yards and two scores. For his effort, he earned Super Bowl MVP honors.  \"That game today is the story of our season,\" Stafford said. \"It’s up and down. It’s tough. And we’re a frickin’ tough team.

Sharpless previously shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine. Barry has a remarkable combination of chemical insight, uncanny intuition and real-world practicality—he is a chemist’s chemist and a wonderful colleague.” “Click chemistry”—a term Sharpless coined—is a set of methods for constructing chemical compounds via irreversible, highly efficient reactions between smaller molecules.

From 1996 to 2015, before joining Stanford, she was a faculty scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a UC Berkeley professor. She also served as the director of the Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science nanoscience user facility located at Berkeley Lab, from 2006 to 2010. The award to Bertozzi brings the number of Nobel Prizes associated with Berkeley Lab scientists to sixteen. (Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Oct. 4, former Lab postdoc John Clauser’s 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics brought the Lab’s tally to fifteen.)

The physics prize went to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger on Tuesday for their experiments that pioneered developments in the field of quantum mechanics. The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.

This multidisciplinary approach inspired collaborations with visiting scientists, including longtime Foundry user K. Barry Sharpless, co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Bertozzi and Morten Meldal. “Carolyn put the Foundry on the map,” said Bruce Cohen, a staff scientist in the Foundry’s Biological Nanostructures facility since 2006. “She oversaw the opening of the facility, which is a major administrative and scientific feat.” He added that Bertozzi’s “science is so creative and original, as well as technically on point, and it’s opened up entire new areas of study. This is a well-deserved Nobel Prize. I couldn’t be happier for her.” Cohen said that Bertozzi is also “a great mentor to all of the scientists around her, and has always been an inspirational role model for both women and LGBTQ people in science.” Bertozzi and others have used her methods to answer fundamental questions about the role of sugars in biology, to study how cells build proteins and other molecules, to develop new cancer medicines, and to produce new materials for energy storage, among many other applications.", "Oct 5, 2022 ...

But one thing the latest Apple event sparked was a reaction for a much lesser known company – Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT). The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality. Apple’s plans for the satellite service came with a plan to spend $450 million to support the feature, with Reuters reporting that a “majority” of that money is being funneled to Globalstar.", "This – on the surface – seemed like a big deal, given that Globalstar posted revenues last year that were less than a third of that amount. But the reality is that Globalstar will have to invest heavily in additional satellites to fulfill its deal to support the Apple service, according to reports. All to say, it will be worth watching how this unfolds. The new frontier is filled with opportunity, and having Apple on your side is a nice way to blaze a trail, or boldly go where no smartphones have gone before.

You have successfully joined our subscriber list. iIn this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. To refer to certain sets of technology stocks that lead the stock market, analysts and investors often use terms like FANG, FAANG, MAANG, MATANA, and more. Investing in these stock groups can have multiple benefits, such as diversification, compensating for any losses that one of the companies may experience, as well as exposure to growing sectors. Many of these companies focus on rapidly growing sectors, such as artificial intelligence (IA), which has become the technological trend of 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Furthermore, by hosting the most popular technology companies, these groups have great liquidity, making it very easy to buy or sell their stocks, and providing greater flexibility for investors to invest in other companies. And obviously, the companies included in these groups have historical success in markets. For example, FANG is composed of four renowned technology companies: Facebook Inc – its name was changed to META Platforms Inc (NYSE: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google LLC (NASDAQ: GOOGL).", "The performance of the MATANA Group in a three-year period, from June 2020 to June 2023, has been remarkable. Nvidia led the way with an impressive 343% increase in its stock price, followed by Tesla with a 276% increase. Amazon has been the only company with negative figures over these 3 years, reflecting a -5% performance. However, it has shown slight signs of recovery from mid-2022 until June 29, 2023, achieving a gain of 12%. It is worth mentioning that the excessive surge in Nvidia’s stock price has been driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence industry. This has led the company to reach the milestone of one trillion dollars in market capitalization in early June 2023, becoming the seventh US company to achieve this feat, which is quite impressive for the renowned gaming GPU company. According to a report from Nasdaq, the best company in the MATANA group for long-term investment is Alphabet. In February 2023, Wall Street maintained a unanimous stance on buying Alphabet shares, with 32 analyst firms promoting its “purchase”. The analysts based their recommendations on Google’s market dominance in search (76% dominance compared to other search engines) since Google is owned by Alphabet. This could continue to strongly drive the company’s long-term growth through the advertising it offers.", "Additionally, they pointed out that Alphabet could be one of the companies with double-digit returns in the coming years, which is highly appealing to long-term investors. It’s important to note that within the first six months of 2023, Nvidia’s shares have experienced a bullish rally that has surprised many, as nobody expected the chip designer to achieve such success in its AI venture, resulting in a modest gain of 187% as of July 2023. Therefore, although Alphabet is considered the best investment option within the MATANA group, it would be wise to pay attention to Nvidia and keep track of its investments before becoming infatuated with a single stock. Who knows if their entry into AI might end up generating better returns than those offered by Alphabet? Ray Wang, Founder, Chairman and Principal Analyst of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc, said the MATANA group should be considered the new name for Big Tech stocks instead of FAANG. Wang believes that MATANA companies significantly outperform FAANG by excluding Meta and Netflix and including tech giants Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. According to Wang, Meta needs a better growth plan beyond advertisements and its foray into the metaverse, while Netflix raises doubts about its growth potential in terms of adding more subscribers. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that Microsoft is one of the technology companies best positioned to excel in the metaverse, cloud computing, and the gaming industry, which generates trillions of dollars annually.", "It’s highly unlikely that this herd of bulls has the long-term forecast wrong.  There’s a big jump down to the MATANA stock with the next best upside, and that’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

Look at how Disney makes its money.\" Wang stressed that Microsoft, which is often viewed as one of tech's leading legacy names, should be included in the group of tech's most elite leaders (and sometimes has been with the bulky FAAMNG acronym). \"Microsoft has more than just business-to-business and consumer – they've been able to manage both,\" he said. \"They're positioned well for the metaverse. They're positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they've got their gaming business.\" Rounding out the new grouping would be Tesla — a well-known success story at this point — and Nvidia. \"Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming,\" Wang said. \"They're sitting at the edge between AI, the metaverse, the future of computing, and the way they do their partnerships, they're set up in a way that's going to be dominant for quite some time.\" Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

If you are interested in the tech sector, maybe the better question is: What’s in an acronym? Because it’s the acronym that spells out just who the cool kids are. You have to go back about nine years to when the now-well-known FAANG group of stocks became a thing. The acronym was the label for all the up-and-coming tech companies that were poised to change our lives: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Almost a decade later, they are considered the most successful U.S. tech companies. They are all household names.", "This has ushered in a new collection of ‘must-have’ tech innovators that dominate their respective markets. Yet with these names commanding $100 to $200 share prices, owing all six may be impractical (until a MATANA exchange-traded fund (ETF) invariably comes along). So how is one to choose among the cream of the crop?  Hakuna Matata, no worries. According to Wall Street research firms, these three MATANA stocks have the best return potential over the next 12-plus months. With an average analyst price target of $137, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most room to run. At current levels, this equates to more than 40% upside. Some sell-side firms see the e-commerce leader going much higher.  Earlier this month, Tigress Financial gave Amazon a $192 target, which suggests the stock can double from here. Given the challenging macro backdrop, others are more cautious. Rosenblatt Securities recently offered a $106 target which is less than 10% upside. Whether Amazon soars or merely inches higher from here will depend on two questions: 1) will inflation and rates cool enough to spur a significant revival in online shopping activity, and 2) will an improved economic outlook push more enterprises to spend on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure?", "As it continues to regroup from a post-pandemic hangover, Amazon gave a cautious outlook for the first quarter of 2023. The extent to which retail spending and digital transformation are on hold won’t be known until Amazon reports Q1 results in late-April. The Street thinks better news and big gains lie ahead.  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a projected gain that’s right behind that of Amazon. The consensus price target is just shy of $130, which means 37% separates Alphabet from its current bogey. It’s upside that seems reasonable considering the online search king is down roughly the same percentage from its February 2022 peak.  Wall Street's unanimously bullish position makes Alphabet a more compelling MATANA pick. Over the past three months, a perfect 32 of 32 firms have called Alphabet stock a ‘buy.’ It's hard to take a contrarian stance when more than two dozen analysts who eat, sleep and breathe the company see Alphabet stock heading higher.  The reset button has effectively been hit for Alphabet after reporting just 2% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Yes, advertisers have pulled back spending in a weakened economy, but it doesn’t change Google’s command of the search market. As macro conditions improve, ad dollars will return because they have to — 76% of today’s searches happen on Google.  This dominance has the Street expecting a return to double-digit profit growth within the next few years.", "Sep 10, 2022 ...

Now the company has confirmed that Apple BKC in Mumbai will open to the public on April 18. But more than that, Apple has also announced a second store in the country that will open on April 20, just two days after the first one. Apple BKC will be the company’s first official store in India. The store is so named because of its location in the business and residential district Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai. India’s first Apple Retail Store has about 22,000 square feet and a flagship architecture. A few days ago, the company unveiled the barricade of the new store, which is covered in a design inspired by the iconic Kaali Peeli taxi art. But surprisingly, that’s not all. Just two days after opening the first Apple Store in India, Apple will open its second store in the country – this time in Delhi. Named Apple Saket, the store will also have all the latest Apple products, plus support service and Today at Apple sessions. According to the company, the two new retail stores mark a “significant expansion in India.” Today Apple announced it will open its doors to customers at two new retail locations in India: Apple BKC in Mumbai on April 18, and Apple Saket in Delhi on April 20.", "Ahead of opening day, customers are invited to download custom Apple BKC and Apple Saket wallpapers, specially curated playlists on Apple Music to move to the sounds of Mumbai and Delhi, and visit apple.com/in/retail/bkc and apple.com/in/retail/saket to learn more about the upcoming openings in India.

India has a growing middle class, a young and \"mobile first\" population willing to pay more for phones, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, two of the country's wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores. Apple's India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said. Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India \"has the potential to reach that scale\" in the coming years. Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country. Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years.", "The part that matters most may have less to do with India’s consumers than with the country’s growing role as a production hub. Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway “since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head.” They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple’s products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, “with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice.” That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that “given Apple’s size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions,” noting that the company has catalyzed China’s growth. “We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops.” Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers. During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city’s “incredible energy, creativity, and passion.", "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US  May 05, 2023 03:29 pm | Updated 05:50 pm IST - New York   COMMents   SHARE   READ LATER   Apple CEO Tim Cook during the inauguration of India’s first Apple retail store in Mumbai on April 18, 2023. | Photo Credit: Reuters  India is at a \"tipping point\" and a major focus for Apple, the technology giant's CEO Tim Cook has said, terming the opening of its first two retail stores in the country - in Mumbai and Delhi - as a “milestone” for the company. Speaking at Apple’s Q2 2023 earnings call on Thursday, Mr. Cook emphasised the dynamism and vibrancy in the Indian market, calling it “unbelievable”. Also Read: Explained | Why Apple wants a retail store in India \"Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record, grew very strong, double digits year-over-year. So it was quite a good quarter for us. Taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It's a major focus for us,” Mr. Cook said. Referring to his recent visit to India, Mr. Cook said in the earnings call, “I was just there, and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable.” Mr.", "More than 20 years after Apple products entered Indian markets, the tech giant is finally set to open its first stores in the country. The two stores - in capital Delhi and India's financial hub Mumbai - will be inaugurated later this month. Bloomberg has reported that Apple chief Tim Cook is likely to visit India next week for the occasion. The unique, colourful design of the Mumbai store - inspired by the black-and-yellow taxis that zip through the city - and hype around the launch have stirred excitement in many Indians. The iPhone is still an aspirational product in the price-sensitive Indian market - more than 95% of smartphones run on Google's Android platform.  Until now, Indians could buy Apple products in the country either online or through a vast network of what the company calls \"premium resellers\". So there has been some speculation about whether the ability to sell products directly to customers in India - the world's second largest smartphone market - will impact its fortunes here. It also comes at a time when India is rising fast as a manufacturing base for the iPhone.  But some experts say that even though the new stores will be important branding tools, they would have little impact on Apple's market share in India.  \"The whole idea of opening an Apple store is to showcase the range of products available in the Apple ecosystem.", "A few days after that, he is set to unlock the doors on the New Delhi store, in a high-end mall in the Saket neighborhood. That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}
