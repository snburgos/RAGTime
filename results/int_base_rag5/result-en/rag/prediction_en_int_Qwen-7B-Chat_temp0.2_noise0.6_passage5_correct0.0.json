The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft.

Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter.

While other shows in this category were also strong contenders, such as Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” “Hacks” proved to be a favorite in this category with its first season. “Hacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,” announced the official Golden Globes account via Twitter. “Congratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best Musical/Comedy Series.” Best Television Series — Drama: “Succession” HBO’s “Succession” was the big winner at this year’s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.", "On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White, Euphoria's Zendaya, and Yellowstone's Kevin Costner.

The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.", "Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year. Similar to NBC’s stance, many actors were absent in a statement to demand change. Winning actors including Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Garfield and Rachel Zegler were not present to receive their awards. While the HFPA has announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain. Despite the controversy, though, many films and television shows have much to celebrate as their casts and crews were recognized for their hard work.  Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy: “West Side Story” After receiving 4 nominations, Steven Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation of the 1957 musical dominated the Comedy/Musical category at the 79th Golden Globe Awards. “West Side Story,” won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture — Musical/Comedy and Best Supporting Actress Role — Motion Picture (Ariana DeBose).

The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation.

How many times did Detroit fans see that same script over the years?  The first time the Lions saw that magic came in Stafford’s eighth NFL start, against the Browns, when he was just 21 years old.", "After taking a hit that rendered his left arm almost immobile, Stafford fought off the team’s trainers to get back on the field and then threw a last-second, game-winning touchdown to Brandon Pettigrew.  It was rough in those early days. Stafford started just three games in 2010, as that ugly “injury-prone” tag started to swirl around him. He came back in 2011 to lead the league in passing attempts and guide Detroit to a surprising playoff berth.  Those images from Sunday night — Stafford on stage, wearing a Super Bowl hat after the Rams beat the Bengals 23-20, bathing in confetti — were what Lions fans dreamed of for so long.

GO FURTHER Burke: Matthew Stafford is a Super Bowl champion, and Lions fans’ conflicted emotions are understandable February 14, 2022 at 8:44 AM EST INGLEWOOD, Calif. — It had to end this way for the Los Angeles Rams, with Aaron Donald swinging Joe Burrow to the ground to force an errant pass, with the all-everything defensive tackle ripping off his helmet in celebration of the Super Bowl-clinching play and emphatically pointing to his ring finger.  The man many consider to be the best football player on the planet now has won the ring he was missing, the only thing left to complete his stellar football resume.", "Super Bowl 56 was full of noteworthy, impactful performances — but only one that could result in Super Bowl MVP.

The fifth-year receiver out of Eastern Washington followed up his All-Pro season with one last impressive performance, catching a game-high eight passes for a team-high 92 yards and two touchdowns.

COOPER KUPP FOR THE LEAD!", "A look: After Beckham was hurt, Kupp had just two catches for 22 yards before the Rams' final offensive series. To create chances for Kupp, McVay decided to go with some tempo, eschewing a huddle in hopes of slowing down the Bengals' pass rush and forcing them into more basic zone coverages. Kupp found soft spots in that zone, and Stafford found Kupp. On that final drive, Kupp had four catches for 39 yards, a 7-yard carry for a first down on fourth-and-1 and the winning score. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, Kupp is the second player with four-plus receptions on a go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter or later of a Super Bowl, joining Pittsburgh's Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII. That came despite the Bengals' best effort to keep Kupp from getting the ball. Before the final touchdown, Kupp drew three straight penalties -- a defensive holding, a defensive pass interference and an unnecessary roughness -- to set up the final score. \"Once we got down in the tight red area, it felt like it was about 60 plays for us to be able to finally get that one in on the fade,\" McVay said. \"And Cooper Kupp is the man.\" Kupp's Super Bowl heroics put the finishing touches on a stellar season in which he cemented himself as one of the league's best players.", "📺: #SBLVI on NBC 📱: https://t.co/K02y40b5Nu pic.twitter.com/vhHjVNRsnC MORE: Cooper Kupp stats: Where does Rams receiver's historic season rank in NFL history Kupp was also instrumental in the Rams' final go-ahead drive: He converted fourth-and-1 at the Rams' 37 with a 7-yard end-around and also caught three passes for 38 yards prior to his game-winning catch.

The best picture race contains the two highest-grossing films of the year, “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Top Gun: Maverick,” along with “Elvis,” a musical biopic that scored with audiences last summer. Other contenders include Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans”;”Tár,” a drama about an abusive conductor; “Women Talking,” a look at the residents of a repressive religious community; and “Triangle of Sadness,” a send-up of the 1% that unfolds partly on a mega-yacht.   \t               \t“Triangle of Sadness,” one of the most divisive films of the year, had a strong showing on Tuesday morning, capturing nominations for his screenplay and for the direction of Ruben Östlund, the Swedish filmmaker who dreamed up the satire.", "5][6] Other winners included All Quiet on the Western Front with four awards, The Whale with two, and Avatar: The Way of Water, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, The Elephant Whisperers, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, An Irish Goodbye, Navalny, RRR, Top Gun: Maverick, Women Talking with one.

It’s a category dominated entirely by men. The last two best director winners, Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”) and Chloe Zhao (“Nomadland”), have been women, and there were some hopes that “Women Talking’s” Sarah Polley might nab a best director nod.  \tThe nominations were announced at a challenging time for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the non-profit behind the awards, and the film business itself. Ratings for the Oscars have declined precipitously in recent years, imperiling the broadcast’s licensing fees, the leading source of revenue for the Academy. At the same time, adult-oriented movies such as “The Fabelmans,” “Tár” and “The Banshees of Inisherin” have struggled at the box office during the pandemic. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that streaming services, which helped fill the void left by the decline in theatrical revenues by providing a platform (and a blank check) for the artists behind them, are also shifting their priorities. Netflix, for instance, has signaled to Wall Street that it will keep content spending relatively flat while it focuses on increasing profits.", "The 95th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), took place on March 12, 2023, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

(“CODA” was released by Apple TV+, which purchased the movie after it played at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021.) The night’s most awarded movie was “Dune,” which won in six categories including cinematography and production design.

Campion’s victory was important for Oscars history: This year’s ceremony became the first time that the best director Oscar has gone to women twice in a row.

From CNN's Lisa Respers France The 95th Academy Awards definitely wasn't like last year's ceremony – and for that, the people behind the scenes are probably breathing a sigh of relief. After \"the slap,\" the Academy instituted a crisis team that was on hand to make sure things didn't get out of hand. But Sunday night was devoid of that type of drama – and of many surprises. As expected, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" was a big winner, taking home the awards for best actress, supporting actor and actress, best original screenplay, best picture and best directing categories. Brendan Fraser bested Austin Butler for best actor, which wasn't exactly an upset as they were both leading contenders. The closest thing that came to a shocker was Sarah Polley's win for best-adapted screenplay for \"Women Talking,\" a small film that felt very much the David that beat out the Goliath of a blockbuster, \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in the category. All of this meant the show was allowed to let the talent and their heartfelt speeches shine.
