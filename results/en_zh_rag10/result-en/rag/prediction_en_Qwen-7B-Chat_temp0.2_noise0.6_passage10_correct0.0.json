At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

Regardless, the two of them–even in the footage from 2010–are still “at the top of their game” as Sklar comments. Putting together a concert film is no easy feat but if anybody can put it together, it’s Frank Marshall. Between the first, second, and encore sets, this concert film can only feature so much material given the broadcast restraints. While I grew up knowing Frank Marshall as someone who produced or executive produced Steven Spielberg movies, the man knows his way with music. Whether it’s as a producer or director, Marshall has done a solid job with music documentaries in recent years. Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name is no exception. Ernie Gilbert’s editing is smart for how the film weaves between past and present as they start introducing the songs. Honestly, I think it’s genius. It’s been fifty years since the two of them first performed together. However, the concert tour took place in honor of the 40th anniversary. The two might have aged since they first performed together but neither Carole King nor James Taylor have lost a beat in all these years!", "Subscribe to CNN Press Room Email Updates Frank Marshall-Directed Film, CAROLE KING & JAMES TAYLOR: JUST CALL OUT MY NAME, Premieres Sunday, Jan. 2 at 9:00PM ET/PT on CNN  CNN Films will premiere CAROLE KING & JAMES TAYLOR: Just Call Out My Name for television on Sunday, Jan. 2, 2022, at 9:00pm ET/PT on CNN.  Also released today are the trailer and poster art for the film.  The new documentary feature is centered around Carole King’s and James Taylor’s legendary 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour, and includes exclusive footage.  The film is directed and produced by Frank Marshall, and produced by Aly Parker and The Kennedy / Marshall Company.     CAROLE KING & JAMES TAYLOR: Just Call Out My Name celebrates King’s and Taylor’s relationship of 50 years.  Their expansive 2010 concert tour reunited these beloved singer/songwriters for a rare musical experience.  The set list for the film contains a breadth of material, including songs that they first performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the famed Los Angeles music venue that initially helped propel them both onto the world stage, and again in 2007 at the club’s 50th anniversary.", "By   \tAlthea Legaspi  Carole King and James Taylor perform their own hits — alongside harmonizing on each other’s songs — in the new trailer for concert documentary Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name.

However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children’s actions. RELATED: 5 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.  If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.", "Jim Carrey is at his all-time Jim Carrey-est, and Jeff Daniels is able to somehow keep up.

At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.", "May 29, 2023 Few things feel like summer, quite like taking a vacation or going to the movies. There’s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there’s something about a silver screen and popcorn that just feels right.  Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we’re treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone: road-trip films.  Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country adventures – almost as if we’re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later.   Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant. It has an incredible soundtrack featuring Sufjan Stevens and stellar performances, including a burgeoning Steve Carell.", "Based on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.", "Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new \"Diverse Representations\" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.", "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.  RELATED: 10 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation.

The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes.

These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "“I went into the game feeling game ready, but I would be lying if I sat here and told you that I wasn’t drinking Pepto Bismol in the (coaching) box because I had an ulcer,” Semore said, laughing. “And the guys, they executed above and beyond.” Semore also was in on the decision that promoted kicker Gavin Stewart, who responded by making all four of his field-goal tries against Pitt after Jude Kelley had struggled in Tech’s first four games. “A thing coach Key always says (is), we’re crazy if we keep doing the same things and expect different results,” Semore said. “It was just one of those things where we all felt comfortable with making that move at that point in time just to see. Let’s give some opportunities to some different guys.” One of those different guys was a ball coach named Jason Semore, who has made good on his chance.

On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself.

That doesn’t make Jason Semore all that different from the scores of other coaches’ sons who populate the staffs around college football. After playing for his dad in high school, then lettering in college, Semore has spent the past 17 years hopscotching from Division II to FCS to FBS, from one side of the country to the other, from small-school coordinator to Power-5 analyst and now, finally, to linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. On Monday he was promoted to the Yellow Jackets’ special teams coordinator, a role he also held in 2015 at the University of Montana. But Semore’s background makes him unlike any coach’s son at the Division I level. Maybe any coach in Division I, period. And the answer lies innocuously at the top of his bio. Hometown: Ganado, Ariz.

That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It’s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more.

Contrary to analysts’ predictions, Tesla delivered 405,278 vehicles and produced 439,000 cars in the fourth quarter.

The 936,000 vehicle deliveries represent an 87 percent increase from 2020, Reuters and other news sources noted,  based on Tesla's announcement dated January 2, while the 306,600 deliveries for the quarter mean that Tesla delivered 71 percent more electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did a year earlier.

Conservative politicians and commentators have repeatedly criticized Twitter and other big tech companies for what they see as overly harsh moderation of right-wing views.

These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021.

That confirms a statement from a verified account tied to Truth Social chief product officer “Billy B,” who told people to mark February 21st on their calendars. “We’re currently set for release in the Apple App Store for Monday, February 21st,” he said, according to Reuters. Incidentally, the 21st marks the Presidents' Day holiday in the US. Provided the network doesn’t suffer a hiccup like the one it did last fall when a prankster claimed the “donaldjtrump” username and posted an image of defecting pig, the launch will mark Trump’s return to social media. Twitter and Facebook banned the former president following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Before a test version of Truth Social was pulled down last fall, the website’s code showed it ran on a mostly unmodified version of open-source software Mastodon. In October, the Software Freedom Conservancy accused The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) of violating Mastodon’s AGPLv3 license by not sharing the platform’s source code. The website added a dedicated section containing a ZIP archive of its source code two weeks later.Subscribe to the Engadget Deals NewsletterGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget’s editorial team.", "With the Android app still unavailable, not a lot has actually changed since Truth Social launched on iPhone. However, there's a workaround. The Truth Social app is still not available to download on Android devices, although it is expected to arrive at some point in the near future. Truth Social is a much newer social media network compared to the likes of Facebook and Twitter, and it is one that promises to offer an open platform that doesn’t discriminate against users based on their political ideology. In fact, this political ideology promise is exactly why Truth Social came to be in the first place. Following the wide banning of Donald Trump across multiple social media network sites in 2021, an alternative service that didn’t censor its users was advertised as in the works. In February of 2022, that alternative service manifested in the launch of Truth Social on iPhone. At the time, Android support was understood to be coming, but there's was no clear indication of when. Related: Trump's Truth Social Posts On Other Platforms Delay, Explained In terms of Android support, not a lot has actually changed since then, and it remains unknown when Truth Social will be available to download from the Google Play Store. Comments last month from the Truth Social CEO confirmed the app was still en route, explaining that it was waiting on approval from Google before it can be made available via the Play Store. How long that approval process takes typically depends on the app.", "On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app, about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically waitlisted.[101][102][103]  The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104]  Upon its launch, the British automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its \"T\" logo.[105]  The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post described it as \"a disaster\".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107]  The Truth Social platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the platform's growth.[108][109]"], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay.

We’ve compiled a recap to keep you abreast of the Activision Blizzard deal’s trials and tribulations. Due to the scale of the deal, regulators around the world fear that this acquisition may hurt competition and give Microsoft — which already owns Xbox — too much power in the gaming market. Fears have centred around the potential effect on market share in the console gaming market.

The company would also become a major stakeholder in esports, and get access to esports leagues and platforms such as Major League Gaming, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League.

The company said that this will be the fastest supercomputer in the world once fully built by mid-2022. The device is said to accelerate AI research and help in building the metaverse, the next major computing platform. A supercomputer can perform high-level processing at a faster rate when compared to a normal computer. Supercomputers are made up of hundreds or thousands of powerful machines which use better artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve operations that process huge amounts of data in less time than normal computers. They work together to perform complex operations that are not possible with normal computing systems, Sanjay Gupta, Vice President, and India Managing Director, NXP India, a global semiconductor company said to The Hindu. Supercomputers require high-speed and specialised chip architectures.", "Meta has been committed to long-term investment in AI since 2013, when we created the Facebook AI Research lab. In recent years, we’ve made significant strides in AI thanks to our leadership in a number of areas, including self-supervised learning, where algorithms can learn from vast numbers of unlabeled examples, and transformers, which allow AI models to reason more effectively by focusing on certain areas of their input. To fully realize the benefits of self-supervised learning and transformer-based models, various domains, whether vision, speech, language, or for critical use cases like identifying harmful content, will require training increasingly large, complex, and adaptable models. Computer vision, for example, needs to process larger, longer videos with higher data sampling rates. Speech recognition needs to work well even in challenging scenarios with lots of background noise, such as parties or concerts. NLP needs to understand more languages, dialects, and accents. And advances in other areas, including robotics, embodied AI, and multimodal AI will help people accomplish useful tasks in the real world. High-performance computing infrastructure is a critical component in training such large models, and Meta’s AI research team has been building these high-powered systems for many years. The first generation of this infrastructure, designed in 2017, has 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster that performs 35,000 training jobs a day.", "By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest.  “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.”  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.", "Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta “To gain better levels of efficiency and performance across our important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that’s co-designed with the model, software stack and the system hardware,” Bjorlin continued. “This provides a better experience for our users across a variety of services.” Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big Tech players.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "At a virtual event this morning, Meta lifted the curtains on its efforts to develop in-house infrastructure for AI workloads, including generative AI like the type that underpins its recently launched ad design and creation tools. It was an attempt at a projection of strength from Meta, which historically has been slow to adopt AI-friendly hardware systems — hobbling its ability to keep pace with rivals such as Google and Microsoft. “Building our own [hardware] capabilities gives us control at every layer of the stack, from datacenter design to training frameworks,” Alexis Bjorlin, VP of Infrastructure at Meta, told TechCrunch. “This level of vertical integration is needed to push the boundaries of AI research at scale.” Over the past decade or so, Meta has spent billions of dollars recruiting top data scientists and building new kinds of AI, including AI that now powers the discovery engines, moderation filters and ad recommenders found throughout its apps and services. But the company has struggled to turn many of its more ambitious AI research innovations into products, particularly on the generative AI front. Until 2022, Meta largely ran its AI workloads using a combination of CPUs — which tend to be less efficient for those sorts of tasks than GPUs — and a custom chip designed for accelerating AI algorithms.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "But Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, “greatly” increases the company’s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads — in turn allowing Meta to run “more enhanced” and “cutting-edge” (ostensibly) AI workloads. Perhaps one day, Meta will relegate the bulk of its AI workloads to banks of MTIAs. But for now, the social network’s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC). First unveiled in January 2022, the RSC — assembled in partnership with Penguin Computing, Nvidia and Pure Storage — has completed its second-phase buildout. Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there’s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Elsewhere, Google’s been touting its own AI-focused supercomputer, which has 26,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs — putting it ahead of Meta’s. Meta’s supercomputer for AI research.

With input from educators and students, we are adapting to ensure we continue to meet their evolving needs.” Among the changes: the digital SAT will be shorter—about two hours instead of three for the current SAT, with more time per question. The digital test will feature shorter reading passages with one question tied to each, and passages will reflect a wider range of topics that represent the works students read in college. Calculators will be allowed on the entire Math section. Students and educators will get scores back in days, instead of weeks. And, to reflect the range of paths that students take after high school, digital SAT Suite score reports will also connect students to information and resources about local two-year college, workforce training programs, and career options. With the transition to digital tests, College Board is working to address inequities in access to technology. Students will be able to use their own device (laptop or tablet) or a school issued device.

It will include two sections (Reading and Writing, Math) with a break in between. Further, the overall test day experience will be shorter since most preadministration activities, such as downloading the exam application and completing the student questionnaire, will happen in advance of test day.

While the transition to digital will bring a number of student- and educator-friendly changes, many important features of the SAT Suite (SAT, PSAT/NMSQT®, PSAT™ 10, PSAT™ 8/9) will stay the same. The SAT Suite will continue to measure the knowledge and skills that students are learning in high school and that matter most for college and career readiness. The SAT will still be scored on a 1600 scale, and educators and students can continue to track growth across the SAT Suite of Assessments over time. The assessments will continue to be administered in a school or in a test center with a proctor present—not at home. Students will still have access to free practice resources on Khan Academy.

Nevertheless, they still used their home locker room. The Bengals used the home locker room of the Los Angeles Chargers, who share the stadium with the Rams.[99] This was the Rams' second Super Bowl in their home market, along with 1979's Super Bowl XIV, which was played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[100]  As the designated home team, the Bengals chose to wear their home black jerseys with white pants.

Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14.

Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations.

Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

For years, the Super Bowl commences on the first Sunday in February. Yet, because money speaks louder than Stephen A. Smith with a microphone, the NFL expanded their season to 17 games. This pushes the league’s premier product to February 13, the latest in the game’s history. SoFi Stadium gets the nod to host the Super Bowl in 2022.

The Economist argued there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics either, another major discipline, and added that Nobel's stipulation of no more than three winners is not readily applicable to modern physics, where progress is typically made through huge collaborations rather than by individuals alone.[27]  In 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995–2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[28]  ^ A.

Sharpless awarded his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry–one of only two chemists to ever receive such an honor.  October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless, PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.", "The Nobel committee said in a statement that “click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions have taken chemistry into the era of functionalism,” adding that “this is bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.” Among her many awards, Bertozzi is a recipient of the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy’s highest scientific honor. She was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1999. She won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 2022. Bertozzi completed her undergraduate degree in chemistry at Harvard University and her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. She has been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator since 2000. She joined Stanford in 2015.

Researchers can probe how biomolecules interact within cells, and they can image living cells without disturbing them. In studies of disease, bioorthogonal reactions are useful for studying not just the cells of patients but also those of pathogens: The proteins in bacteria can be labeled to follow their movements through the body. Researchers are also starting to develop engineered antibodies that can click onto their tumor targets to deliver cancer-killing therapeutics more precisely. “These very important accomplishments and these really fantastic discoveries from our three laureates have really made an enormous impact on chemistry and on science in general,” Ramström said. “For that, it’s really been to the greatest benefit of humankind.” Who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in recent years? Last year, Benjamin List and David MacMillan won the prize for their development of asymmetrical organocatalysis.

The Super Bowl is an annual American football games which determines the champion of the NFL. The game involves the winning team from the American Football Conference championship game facing the winning team from the National Football Conference championship game. Since 1967 when the merger agreement took place between the NFC and AFC, teams have been competing to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the great coach of the Green Bay Packers. It was this team that won the first two Super Bowls, raising questions over whether the AFC was good enough to compete in the event. Originally the NFL and AFL, the two leagues combined into one league in 1970 and instead split into two conferences, with 3 NFL teams converting over to the AFC to equal 13 teams on each side. The term Super Bowl was created by Kansas City Chief Owner Lamar Hunt after seeing his daughter play with a toy called the Super Ball. Only supposed to be a nickname until an official name was released, the term Super Bowl has stuck with the game ever since. Since the first game in 1967, the AFC has managed to win 11 Super Bowls with the NFC blitzing in with 23 Super Bowl championships.

Less than a week after launch, Lost Ark has become Steam’s highest-played MMORPG ever. “We’re working closely with Smilegate RPG to add more content, regular updates, and maintain a thriving global player community in Lost Ark for years to come,” said Christoph Hartmann, VP, Amazon Games.

Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam’s biggest hits of 2022, but the game’s complicated release structure has many people wondering what time the red hot title will fully be released and when they’ll be able to join the millions that are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking.  Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder’s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8).

In short, anyone hoping to jump into Lost Ark when it goes free-to-play on Friday should probably plan to start playing the game as soon as possible.

Both shows follow a team of a reformed grifter, thief, hacker, hitter, and the inside man as they use their unique skills to help regular people fight injustice in cases when all other options have been exhausted. And although not every episode features a heist specifically, more often than not the Leverage team is attempting (and usually succeeding) to steal something be it a painting, important documents, or a billionaire’s reputation.

The website's critics consensus reads, \"While Morena Baccarin's vampish performance is commendably campy, The Endgame is too contrived and silly to justify its labyrinthine structure.\"[19] On Metacritic, the series has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 7 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[20]", "It’s a violent and disturbing series, made all the more so by the fact that James Purefoy makes it very believable that someone like Carroll would command such devout and dangerous loyalty from those who essentially worship him. The Fall is yet another series that focuses its story on a battle of wits between law enforcement and a serial killer. What’s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who exudes his familiar charm and charisma. While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there’s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It’s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series. Like other great serial crime dramas, one of the most appealing things about The Endgame is the light that it sheds on the workings of the FBI. Those who enjoy that particular aspect of the series will also find much to like about Quantico.", "The show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O’Neil (played by the dashing Dougray Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles – and maybe even the world – had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood’s elite to notice the elaborate heist unfold.    NBC’s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently premiered on the network.

This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).", "This series, one of the best that Netflix has made, focuses on this powerful figure, as well as the man whose mission it is to take him out, including Javier Pena (played by Pedro Pascal in one of his best roles). RELATED: 10 Most Underrated Thrillers Of The 2010s Though Narcos can be a bit grim at times, and though its characters are often morally compromised, it still remains a powerful drama about the darkness of the drug trade. The original Fargo is often regarded as one of the Coen Brothers' best movies, and a great deal of its grimly hilarious sensibility has made its way into the series. Each of its first three seasons (though not as much the fourth) focused on a cat and mouse game that will be very familiar to those who enjoyed The Endgame, as officers of the law matched wits with formidable criminal minds that were willing and able to commit acts of great cruelty and malice. Like other great crime dramas, the series excelled at showing the sinister side of the human condition. The iconic Kevin Bacon has been in many great movies and TV series, and The Following is one of those. Like The Endgame, the series focuses on a cat and mouse game between an FBI agent and a sinister figure, in this case, Joe Carroll, a charismatic serial killer.", "Those who enjoy the cat and mouse thriller The Endgame will be glad to know that there are a number of other similar television shows. The thriller genre is one that has been experiencing a bit of a golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It’s actually easy to see why the genre would continue to maintain its popularity. RELATED: 10 Thriller Movies With The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, constantly wondering just what’s going to happen and how the mystery (or mysteries) will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It’s a densely woven series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There’s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader’s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles. American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.", "The Endgame is an American crime drama thriller television series that premiered on NBC on February 21, 2022.

After a series of humiliating retreats, his initial invasion plan has clearly failed, but Russia's war is far from over. Even now, Russia's leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a \"special military operation\". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country.  His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.  He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status. President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine's elected president. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Volodymyr Zelensky.", "346] This came as the culmination of prolonged infighting and power struggles between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense.[347] After around 24 hours, the Wagner Group backed down and agreed to a peace deal in which Wagner's leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus, and his forces would be free of prosecution.[346] On 27 June, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Ukraine were \"highly likely\" to have reclaimed territory in the eastern Donbas region occupied by Russia since 2014 among its advances. Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[348]  Aerial warfare began on the first day of the invasion. By September, the Ukrainian air force was still at 80% of its prewar strength and had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.[349][350] By late December, 173 Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs were confirmed to have been shot down, whereas Russia had lost 171 aircraft. With the beginning of the invasion, dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.[80][81] Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine also reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] Starting in mid-October, Russian forces launched massive missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intending to knock out energy facilities throughout the country.", "Jump to        Russia surprised the world on February 24, 2022, by invading Ukraine, starting a brutal battle that is still raging today. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.", "[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]", "Russia lost nearly all of the northeastern region of Kharkiv, infuriating Putin and demonstrating Ukraine’s ability to repel the Russian military by force. In response, the Russians attacked Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving many without power and water. The Associated Press Putin delivered a speech outlining his plan to mobilize an additional 300,000 troops in an effort to reclaim lost territory. The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return. The Associated Press Putin signed final papers to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the West dismissed as shams. In response, the U.S. and its allies slapped sanctions on more than 1,000 Russian people and companies, building on significant financial penalties already imposed on the nation since the invasion.

Russian officials called the incident a “terrorist attack” and blamed Ukraine’s chief of military intelligence for orchestrating it, but Ukraine has not claimed responsibility. Russia later retaliated by launching missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, including on civilian areas.", "Russian air strikes and a ground invasion launched at a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the Donbas. Ukraine enacted martial law and ordered a general mobilisation.  Russian troops retreated from the northern front by April 2022. On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. In April, Russia launched a renewed battle of Donbas. Russian forces continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly-occupied oblasts. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast. In February 2023, Russia mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers for a new offensive in Donbas. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast.  The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-11/1 condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid and sales to Ukraine.", "In March, Russia organised a controversial referendum and annexed Crimea. This was followed by the outbreak of the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 when armed Russia-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings, proclaiming the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.[31][32] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[33][34][35] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[36] A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[37][38] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing that it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a \"vassal\" of the United States.[39]  The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land to create Novorossiya (New Russia).[40] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation was a \"manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism\".", "Northeastern Ukraine campaign  Eastern Ukraine campaign  Southern Ukraine campaign  2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive  Other regions  Naval operations  Spillover and cross-border incidents  Resistance  Related  Attacks on civilians  On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War which began in 2014. The invasion has killed tens of thousands on both sides. Russian forces have been responsible for mass civilian casualties and for torturing captured Ukrainian soldiers. By June 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced. More than 8.2 million had fled the country by May 2023, becoming Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage, widely described as ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.  Prior to the invasion, Russian troops concentrated near Ukraine's borders, as Russian officials denied plans to attack. Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" to support the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces were fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict, claiming the goal was to \"demilitarise\" and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the ethnic Russian minority.", "(GRIGORY SYSOYEV/AFP/Getty Images) Early in 2021, Zelenskyy cracked down on pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs, including Viktor Medvedchuk, a close friend of Putin. Subsequently, Putin deploys increasing numbers of troops near the Ukrainian border and publishes an article claiming that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people.” By December, tens of thousands of Russian troops are deployed to the borders and Putin issues demands to NATO and the United States. Among these demands is that Ukraine never be admitted to NATO – a request rejected by the Biden administration.  (Vadim Ghirda/AP) In 2014, the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk broke away from Ukraine, under the leadership of what the Ukrainian government considered to be Russian-backed terrorists. Following the breakdown of relations with NATO and the West in late February, Putin recognized these territories as independent states and sent troops in to “keep the peace.” (Emilio Morenatti/AP) Days after recognizing the breakaway territories, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began in the eastern Ukrainian territory of Donbas. Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine and officially broke diplomatic ties with Russia.

Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.

A post shared by Iga Świątek (@iga.swiatek) Answering most questions through her first two matches, the 21-year-old dropped a combined two games against Danielle Collins and Veronika Kudermetova to book a championship match with Pegula, who has continued to impress in the aftermath of a breakthrough 2022 season.", "11] As of January 2022, Świątek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of second-week progressions.[12] In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.[13][14]  In February, Świątek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.[15]  At Indian Wells, Świątek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth title. With the back-to-back Masters wins, Świątek reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2.[16]", "The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close, and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022 by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.", "The 2022 Iga Świątek tennis season officially began on 3 January 2022 as the start of the 2022 WTA Tour.[2] Iga Świątek entered the season as world number 9. The season saw the Polish player become the twenty-eighth world number 1 player in singles.[3] A 37-match win streak was accumulated during the season, the longest in the twenty-first century.[4]  Świątek started her season at the Adelaide International in January, seeded fifth. After wins against Daria Saville, Leylah Fernandez, and Victoria Azarenka, Świątek lost to Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals.[5] She was scheduled to play at the Sydney International, seeded sixth, and her first match was scheduled to be against Emma Raducanu,[6] but she pulled out of the tournament due to a rib injury.[7]  Świątek entered into the Australian Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated qualifier Harriet Dart in the first round, Rebecca Peterson in the second round and Daria Kasatkina in the third round. All wins were in straight sets.[8][9][10] She reached her first Australian Open quarterfinal after defeating Sorana Cîrstea in the fourth round.", "The world No. 1 enjoyed a week of renewed dominance after a disappointing Australian swing, easing to her 12th career title without dropping a set.ByDavid KanePublished Feb 18, 2023 copy_link Published Feb 18, 2023 Are we at the start of a new streak? For the second year in a row, Iga Swiatek leaves the Qatar TotalEnergies Open undefeated, knocking out Jessica Pegula, 6-3, 6-0 to win her 12th career title in Doha with the loss of five total games in three matches.Swiatek rode a 37-match win streak that began in the Middle East and took her to a whopping six titles in 2022—including a Sunshine Double and a second Roland Garros title—and after an underwhelming start to her season, the world No. 1 is back in the winner’s circle without dropping a set, defeating Pegula in one hour and nine minutes on Center Court.Her trip Down Under indeed yielded less than her sky-high expectations, featuring a first loss to Pegula since 2019 at United Cup and a fourth-round exit at the Australian Open to Elena Rybakina. Playing her first tournament since Melbourne, all eyes were on the Pole as she aimed to reassert her dominance over the tour.", "In the fourth round she was defeated by reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in straight sets.[69]  In February 2023, Świątek successfully defended her title at the WTA 500 Qatar Open. She defeated Jessica Pegula in the final in straight sets. This was her first title of the year and the twelfth of her career. She did not drop a set throughout the tournament and only lost five games.[70] At the Dubai Tennis Championships, she defeated Leylah Fernandez, 14th seed Liudmila Samsonova, Karolina Pliskova (by walkover) and fifth seed Coco Gauff, all matches in straight sets with only nine games lost, to reach the final.[71] She lost to Barbora Krejčíková in straight sets, ending her six match winning streak.[72]  On 13 March she reached her 50th consecutive week at world No. 1.[73][74] At the Indian Wells Open she defeated Bianca Andreescu and Emma Raducanu in rounds three and four, both in straight sets.[75][76][77] However, she lost once again to Elena Rybakina in the semifinals, preventing Świątek from defending her Indian Wells title. [78] Due to a rib injury suffered during the Indian Wells event, Świątek withdrew from the 2023 Miami Open, which also prevented her from defending her Miami Open title.", "41] As a result, she entered the top 15 for the first time in her career, in March 2021.[42]  Seeded 15th, Świątek won her first career WTA 1000-title at the Italian Open, defeating former champion Karolína Plíšková in just 46 minutes without the loss of a single game. She advanced to the final after defeating two-time champion and world No. 5, Elina Svitolina, and the second best-ranked teenager Coco Gauff on the same day, as well as saving match points in her third-round match against Barbora Krejčíková.[43] Świątek became the third player to win a title after saving match point en route in 2021, alongside Naomi Osaka at the Australian Open and Ashleigh Barty in Miami. She also became the fourth teenager to win a WTA 1000 event.[44][45] This successful run to her third career title moved her into the top 10 in the singles rankings on 17 May 2021, as world No. 9.[46]  At the French Open, Świątek was seeded at No. 8. She opened her title defense winning against Kaja Juvan in the first round, and then defeated Rebecca Peterson, Anett Kontaveit and Marta Kostyuk.", "Iga Swiatek has done it again. For the second time this year, she’s standing at the top of a podium, holding a Grand Slam trophy above her head. This time, she defeated Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6(5) to win the 2022 US Open, capping off a year of incredible and unexpected success. Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments. Swiatek claimed the first set in 30 minutes flat, and made it look as effortless as ever.", "3: Top 10 players Swiatek defeated en route to her first title of the season in Doha. The win is the second WTA 1000 title of her career.  0: Wins for Swiatek against Maria Sakkari (0-3) and Aryna Sabalenka (0-1) going into Doha.

Expectations were high for the Norwegians again in 2022, as they seemed likely to win a large number of medals at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Although Norway didn't break its own record, many of the nation's athletes had impressive showings. The Norwegians won 37 total medals at this year's Winter Games, which are now complete. That's tied for the second-most at a single Winter Olympics with the United States, which also won 37 in 2010. Here's the final medal count for the 2022 Winter Games, followed by a closer look at the countries that will be leaving Beijing with the most gold.  1. Norway: 37 (16 golds, eight silvers, 13 bronzes) 2. Russian Olympic Committee: 32 (six golds, 12 silvers, 14 bronzes) 3. Germany: 27 (12 golds, 10 silvers, five bronzes) 4.

The 21st century has been a relatively strong one for the U.S. at the Winter Olympics. It had three second-place finishes in overall medal count from 2002 through 2014 and even stood atop the table with 37 medals at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Team USA landed in fourth overall with 23 medals in PyeongChang last time out. The past two decades have been a refreshing return to form for the U.S. on the Winter Olympic stage. The nation only stood atop the medal table one time in the 20th century, back in 1932 when Lake Placid was the host city for the first time. The U.S. is the sole leader in medals for two sports, but its top sport by quantity of medals, speed skating, actually isn’t one of them. Team USA has earned the most medals in figure skating (51) and snowboarding (31).", "With all 109 medal events decided, competition at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing is officially complete.  After three weeks of dominance, Norway stands alone atop the chart with the most total medals (37) and the most gold medals (16). Norway broke its own record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 16, to go along with eight silver medals and 13 bronze medals. (Norway and Germany in 2018 both matched the record of 14 gold medals at a single Winter Olympics previously set by Canada in Vancouver 2010.) Norway narrowly missed eclipsing its high-water mark of 39 total medals, won in PyeongChang. The United States finished the Games with eight gold medals -- tied for the fourth most along with Sweden and the Netherlands. But America's total medal count of 25 put them fifth. In addition to eight golds, the U.S. tallied 10 silver medals and seven bronze medals. [RELATED: 2022 Winter Olympics medal count] The ROC finished second with 32 total medals (6 gold, 12 silver, 14 bronze). Germany, after absolutely dominating the sliding sports with gold medals in nine out of 10 events, slotted third with 27 total medals (12 gold, 10 silver, 5 bronze). And Canada eclipsed the U.S. for fourth with 26 total medals (4 gold, 8 silver, 14 bronze).", "The 2022 Winter Olympics will give athletes from across the globe the chance to have their country’s national anthem played following their triumphs. If history is any indication, crowds expect to hear some songs on repeat. The Winter Olympics are often dominated by Europe with the United States and Canada in the mix throughout the competition. Countries that rose to the top of the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation has the highest medal count of all time? Here are the 10 countries with the most total medals in Winter Olympics history before the start of the 2022 Winter Games:  Total: 130 Gold: 45 Watch all the action from the Beijing Olympics live on NBC Silver: 44 Bronze: 41 Medals won in PyeongChang: 20 Sport with most medals: Speed skating (121) Dutch speed skaters famously take the ice wearing orange, but they often leave it wearing gold. The Netherland’s 121 speed skating medals are 37 more than any other country in the sport. The total is also nearly twice as much as the country’s haul in its top summer sport, swimming (62).", "The nation has 20 or more total medals in three other sports: ski jumping (25), luge (22) and figure skating (20).  Total: 259 Gold: 100 Silver: 94 Bronze: 65 Medals won in PyeongChang: 31 Sport with most medals: Biathlon (52) Germany is one of just three countries to lead a Winter Olympics in medals four times (1992, 1998, 2002 and 2006). East Germany finished top two in the medal count at each Winter Olympics from 1972 through 1988 and led the 1980 Games with 23. Fast forward to 2018 and Germany put together an impressive performance in PyeongChang. Its 31 medals were second of any country and its 14 golds tied for first. Germany is the medals leader for two sports: biathlon and luge (37). Combined with East Germany (29), West Germany (10) and the United Team of Germany (5), it makes up 57.4% of the medals ever dished out in the sport’s history.", "The country has 18 alpine skiing medals -- including two golds from PyeongChang -- 16 speed skating medals, 14 biathlon medals, 11 ice hockey medals and 10 figure skating medals. Sweden took home seven gold medals from PyeongChang in 2018, good for sixth out of all participating countries. Their collection of 14 total medals tied for 10th. Total: 167 Gold: 43 Silver: 63 Bronze: 61 Medals won in PyeongChang: 6 Sport with most medals: Cross country skiing (80) Like Sweden, Finland’s top Winter Olympic sport is cross country skiing with 80 total medals. After cross country skiing, the country’s next-best sports are speed skating (24 total medals), ski jumping (22) and Nordic combined (14).  Finland had far and away the smallest haul from the 2018 Winter Olympics, winning just six total medals and only one gold. Four of the six medals, including the gold, came in cross-country skiing. A smaller collection is not uncommon for Finland despite their seventh-place spot on this list. It is the only country among the 10 included here that has never won 15 or more medals at a single Winter Olympics.", "Russia officially has 121 medals from 1994 through 2014, but the International Olympic Committee began stripping the nation of its medals earned during the 2014 Sochi Games. The number of medals the country has can change if any additional medals are stripped or reallocated by the IOC. In 2018, Russian athletes competed under the name Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and earned 17 medals. They will participate under the same designation in Beijing. The total sum of medals from these three eras would put the country in second place all-time on this list. Total: 232 Gold: 64 Silver: 81 Bronze: 87 Medals won in PyeongChang: 14 Sport with most medals: Alpine skiing (121) Austria has completely dominated alpine skiing throughout Winter Olympic history. Its 121 medals make up more than half of its entire medal haul (52.2%) and 26.2% of the medals ever handed out in the sport at the Olympics. Seven of the country’s 14 medals at the 2018 Games came in alpine skiing. The country brought its alpine skiing prowess to PyeongChang, tying Switzerland for first with seven medals in the sport. Austria also picked up three medals in luge, one in biathlon, one in Nordic combined and one in snowboarding.", "The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February. A total of 2,871 athletes from 91 nations participated in 109 events in seven sports across 15 disciplines.[1][2]  Overall 29 nations received at least one medal, and 23 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Norway won the most medals overall, with 37, and the most gold medals, with 16. The latter record was the highest gold medal tally at a single Winter Games.[3] Host nation China won nine gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the 2010 winter edition.[4] Athletes from that nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the 2006 and 2010 winter editions.[5]  Biathletes Johannes Thingnes Bø, Quentin Fillon Maillet, and Marte Olsbu Røiseland, and cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov won the most total medals at the games with five each.[6] Bø also earned the most gold medals with four.[7] Snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand won the first Winter Olympic gold medal for that nation.", "The 32 medals won by Russian athletes mark the most medals ever won by Russian athletes in on Winter Olympics, regardless of representation. Host-nation China delivered its best Winter Olympics performance, scoring the third-most gold medals (9) but ranking 11th with 15 total medals. The nation's previous best total was 11 total medals, reached in both 2006 and 2010. For the United States, Nathan Chen, Jessie Diggins, Lindsey Jacobellis, Elana Meyers Taylor, and Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue all secured multiple medals. Jacobellis is the only athlete to win two gold medals.  After PyeongChang saw a Winter Olympics-record 30 different National Olympic Committees win medals, 29 different NOCs claimed at least one medal in Beijing. We've come a long way since the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix, France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case.

This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone.

The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one.

The latest version of Android almost always gets a showcase during Google I/O, and we can't imagine 2023 will be much different. For this year's show, the focus will be on Android 14, the next version of Google's mobile operating system set to come out in late summer.  The first developer preview of Android 14 came out in February, followed by Developer Preview 2 just a day after Google set the date for I/O. We've now got an Android 14 beta that's available to download, too. Even though that first beta is out, the I/O keynote traditionally serves as an excellent platform for alerting people to Android updates, new features and enhancements. We expect that to continue with Google I/O 2023. Thanks to the Android 14 developer previews and the beta release, we already know some of Android 14's features. Highlights include app cloning, which allows you to use one app with different sign-in credentials, and a guest profile for using the phone app.", "Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and featured announcements on everything from Pixel Fold to Bard.

The rover is aboard the Tianwen-1 probe that arrived in Mars orbit on February 24 and is due to land in May to look for evidence of life.  It is part of Chinese space plans that include launching a crewed orbital station and landing a human on the moon.

Chinese scientists are looking forward to finding more evidence of water-ice.The scientific goals of Tianwen-1 include mapping the morphology and geological structure, investigating surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution, analyzing the surface material composition, measuring the ionosphere and the characteristics of the Martian climate and environment at the surface and perceiving the physical fields and internal structure of Mars.The orbiter is equipped with seven kinds of scientific instruments: two remote-sensing cameras, Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar, Mars Mineralogy Spectrometer, Mars Magnetometer, Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer and Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer.", "The top candidate for the landing site is Utopia Planitia, a rock-strewn plain where the U.S. lander Viking 2 touched down in 1976.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I’ll often refer to it as having a “laptop cart” look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.  With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company’s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It’s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

By Julia Jacobs Nearly a year after Will Smith slapped him onstage at the Oscars, Chris Rock joked about the explosive moment on a live Netflix show Saturday night, using the last few minutes to mock Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. “Now I watch ‘Emancipation,’ just to see him get whooped,” Rock said, referencing last year’s Civil War-era drama in which Smith plays an enslaved man who is forced to labor for the Confederacy. In the days after Smith stunned the world with the slap, Rock, a comedian not known to shy away from controversy, was expected to quickly make his feelings about the episode known. Instead, he said at his first show after the Oscars that he was still processing what had happened, and he assured fans that there would be a time and place for him to discuss it in depth. That time and place turned out to be Saturday, at the Hippodrome Theater in Baltimore, in a stand-up show that was live-streamed for the rest of the world.

Pinkett Smith addressed the slap on an episode of her talk show \"Red Table Talk\" in which she emphasized compassion for both Smith and Rock. \"Now, about Oscar night … my deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out and reconcile,\" she said. \"The state of the world today, we need them both, and we all actually need one another more than ever.\" Timeline: Will Smith and Chris Rock's rocky relationship predates the Oscars slap by six years Pinkett Smith continued: \"'Til then, Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years and that's to keep figuring out this thing called life together.", "It was one of the most infamous moments in Academy Awards history that became known as \"the slap.\" The world could not stop talking about Will Smith striking comedian Chris Rock onstage at the 2022 Oscars after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.  A lot has happened since the slap: Will Smith apologized (twice) and was banned from Academy events for 10 years. Chris Rock finally addressed the incident in-depth during a live comedy special, nearly a year after it happened. And the 2023 Oscars went down without any slaps – though the moment was certainly a talker during the show. Here's everything to know about the slap and everything that's happened since. The controversy began when Rock appeared onstage to present the Academy Award for best documentary feature during the 2022 Oscars ceremony. In his introduction, Rock made a joke about a possible \"G.I. Jane\" sequel in reference to Pinkett Smith's bald head. Smith appeared to first laugh at Rock's joke, though Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes and looked upset. Afterward, Smith walked up to the stage, slapped Rock and returned to his seat amid confusion in the crowd about whether the segment was scripted or real.  \"Will Smith just slapped the (expletive) out of me,\" Rock deadpanned to the audience.", "\"Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited,\" he said.   For more on the Will Smith-Chris Rock incident at the Oscars, listen below to our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day.   The debacle at Sunday's awards show unraveled after Rock made light of Jada's hair loss, which she's recently opened up about as a result of her years-long struggle with alopecia. \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see ya,\" he joked.   Will, 53, then walked onto stage and smacked Rock in the face, leaving the audience and live viewers around the world stunned. \"Oh wow,\" said a seemingly taken-aback Rock as Will made his way back to his seat. \"Will Smith just smacked the s— out of me.\"   \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth!\" Smith yelled up to the stage at Rock after taking his seat again.   \"Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,\" said Rock — to which Smith replied once again, \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth!\"   \"I'm going to, okay?\" Rock replied, before going on to say, \"That was the ... greatest night in the history of television\" and presenting the award.", "Here's a timeline of everything that has gone down between the two actors since the headline-making slap.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \tRania Aniftos   \tIt’s been almost a year since the slap heard around the world, when Will Smith stormed the stage at the Oscars on March 27, 2022, to smack Chris Rock across the face on live television.  \tThe tense moment occurred after Rock made an onstage joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, during the Academy Awards ceremony. “Jada, I love you. G.I Jane 2, can’t wait to see it,” the comedian said about her shaved head — which, unbeknownst to Rock, is caused by the actress’ struggles with alopecia.  \tPinkett Smith rolled her eyes in response, while Smith laughed. Shortly after, the King Richard actor ran up on stage to slap Rock, who attempted to continue his banter before Smith began shouting from his seat, “Keep my wife’s name out your f—ing mouth.”  \tIn the year since then, Smith has issued a number of apologies, others who were present at the situation have spoken up about what went down and Chris Rock has make jokes about the incident throughout his comedy specials.   \tWith the 2023 Oscars on the way, see below for a timeline of everything that has gone down between Smith and Rock since the slap.", "105] In the clips taken from a CBS Mornings interview, Carrey stated, \"You do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words\",[91] and that he would have sued Smith for $200 million if he were in Rock's position, saying, \"That video is going to be there forever. It's going to be ubiquitous. That insult is going to last a very long time.\" He further criticized the moral integrity of the Hollywood film industry for giving Smith a standing ovation after receiving his award.[106]  Anthony Hopkins, who presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating: \"Will Smith said it all. What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\"[107]  Comedians, including George Wallace and Kathy Griffin, spoke out about how the incident had worried them about potential future confrontations, and that they might be more careful about the topics of jokes going forward.[108][109] Howie Mandel connected the Rock and Chappelle incidents, stating: \"That [slap] opened the floodgates. You saw what happened at the Academy Awards, and I thought that [...] violence triggers violence, and I think this is the beginning of the end for comedy\".[110]", "[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.", "After the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it “does not condone violence of any form.” The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was aware of the incident. “The incident involved one individual slapping another,” the statement read. “The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.” “That was the greatest night in the history of television,” Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs — on stage to introduce a tribute to “The Godfather” — tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars afterparty. “Will and Chris, we’re going to solve that like family at the Gold party,” Combs said. The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few — if anyone — wanted to discuss. “I’m not talking about that,” said Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the director of “Summer of Soul,” which won an Oscar for best documentary. The confrontation overshadowed Smith’s milestone accomplishment.", "Filed under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.", "Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]"], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[376]  Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]", "239] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2–1 by virtue of goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[240][241]  The semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December.[31] Messi scored a penalty kick before Julián Álvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3–0 victory over Croatia, their biggest win margin in the 2022 tournament, reaching their sixth final and first since 2014.[242] Théo Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game. Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 78th minute to complete a 2–0 victory for France over Morocco as they reached their second consecutive final.[243]  The third place play-off was played on 17 December.

It was a variation of the Adidas Al Rihla used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas Al-Hilm, meaning \"The Dream\" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup.[22] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.", "110] Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.[111][112]  Of the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018.[113] Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934.

The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.", "[8] Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter's board of directors with private equity firm Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban. He relayed this idea to Twitter board chair Bret Taylor and CEO Parag Agrawal, proposing to either take the company private or start a rival social media platform.[9] Dorsey responded to Musk with a text message, saying he hoped Twitter could become open-sourced and that he had unsuccessfully pushed for Musk's induction into Twitter's board a year earlier, a move that prompted his departure from his role as CEO.[10]  Musk began purchasing Twitter stock on January 31, 2022.[7] On April 4, he announced that he had acquired 9.2 percent of the company's shares totaling $2.64 billion,[11] making him the company's largest shareholder.[12] Following the announcement, Twitter's stock experienced its largest intraday surge since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, rising by as much as 27 percent.[13] The next day, Twitter invited Musk to join the company's board,[14] which Musk accepted.[15] This had been recommended to the board by Twitter's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee three days earlier, with some board members expressing concern about potential \"adverse impacts on stockholder value\".", "The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn (£38.1bn) takeover of Twitter, according to a filing with the US government. Mr Musk tweeted \"the bird is freed\" and later said \"let the good times roll\". A number of top executives, including the boss, Parag Agrawal, have reportedly been fired. Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction. A filing was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, confirming the takeover.  The New York Stock Exchange said on Friday that trading in Twitter's shares had been suspended, giving the reason as \"merger effective\". Allow Twitter content?

A court has given Elon Musk until Friday to close his April agreement to acquire the company after he earlier tried to back out of the deal. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) Elon Musk has taken over Twitter and fired its CEO and other top executives. Trading in company shares was suspended Friday on the New York Stock Exchange and the stock will be officially delisted early next month, according to a filing with securities regulators. So now what? One reason why Musk bought Twitter this week is because he had little choice. The world’s richest man spent months trying to back out of the $44 billion purchase agreement he originally signed in April. But the uncertainty was so disruptive to Twitter’s business that it sued him in the Delaware Court of Chancery to force the deal’s completion, and a judge gave a Friday deadline to complete the deal or face a November trial that Musk was likely to lose.  As for why Musk wanted to own Twitter in the first place, the reasons are more complicated. “There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising,” he said in an open letter Thursday to companies that sell ads on Twitter, which is how the company makes money. “Most of it has been wrong.", "[8] Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter's board of directors with private equity firm Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban. He relayed this idea to Twitter board chair Bret Taylor and CEO Parag Agrawal, proposing to either take the company private or start a rival social media platform.[9] Dorsey responded to Musk with a text message, saying he hoped Twitter could become open-sourced and that he had unsuccessfully pushed for Musk's induction into Twitter's board a year earlier, a move that prompted his departure from his role as CEO.[10]  Musk began purchasing Twitter stock on January 31, 2022.[7] On April 4, he announced that he had acquired 9.2 percent of the company's shares totaling $2.64 billion,[11] making him the company's largest shareholder.[12] Following the announcement, Twitter's stock experienced its largest intraday surge since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, rising by as much as 27 percent.[13] The next day, Twitter invited Musk to join the company's board,[14] which Musk accepted.[15] This had been recommended to the board by Twitter's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee three days earlier, with some board members expressing concern about potential \"adverse impacts on stockholder value\".", "Oct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday closed the $44 billion deal announced in April to take Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) private and took ownership of the influential social media platform by firing top executives immediately. \"The bird is freed,\" he tweeted in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company has fewer limits on content that can be posted. But Musk provided little clarity on how he will achieve his goals.  read more Earlier this month, Musk brought the deal back on the table after previously trying to walk away from it. Musk had said he was excited to buy Twitter but he and his co-investors are overpaying. Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.", "Business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.", "30][31] The funding included $7 billion of senior secured bank loans; $6 billion in subordinated debt; $6.25 billion in bank loans to Musk personally, secured by $62.5 billion of his Tesla stock; $20 billion in cash equity from Musk, to be provided by sales of Tesla stock and other assets; and $7.1 billion in equity from 19 independent investors.[32][33][34]  The initially proposed $13 billion in money borrowed by Twitter is equivalent to seven times the company's 2022 projected operating cash flow; some banks found that multiple too risky and opted to participate only in the $12.5 billion margin loan to Musk.[35] The debt is estimated to cost Twitter approximately $1 billion in annual interest and fees.[30] Two days after announcing his bid, Musk registered three holding companies under the name \"X Holdings\" in preparation for his takeover.[36] Tesla shares fell 12 percent on the day after the acquisition was announced, amid smaller declines in the broader markets. Musk incurred a $21 billion paper loss that day. Within three days after Twitter agreed to be acquired, Musk had sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla shares.[37][38]", "On May 4, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom summoned Musk to discuss the effect of his buyout on free speech and \"online harms\".[66] Musk secured another $7.1 billion in funding the next day, including from Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding.[67][68] The equity infusion reduced his original $12.5 billion personal bank loan to $6.25 billion and his required cash equity contribution from $21 billion to just under $20 billion.[34][69] On May 11, The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched investigations into events leading to the acquisition.[70] The next day, Agrawal fired Twitter general manager Kayvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.[71]  On May 13, Musk revealed that he had placed the deal \"on hold\" in the wake of reports that 5 percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[72] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[73] Musk clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[74] and Agrawal stated he expected the deal to close.", "137][138] Musk privately offered to purchase Twitter at the reduced prices of $31 billion and $39.6 billion, both of which the company rejected.[139][140]  On October 3, Musk's legal team informed Twitter that Musk had changed his mind and decided to move forward with his proposed acquisition at the originally agreed-upon price of $54.20 per share, on the condition that Twitter drop its lawsuit.[141] The reason for this reversal was attributed to concerns from Musk's team that they would not be able to prove that there was a material adverse effect justifying a break from contract. Musk and Agrawal's depositions were originally scheduled for October 6 and 10, respectively.[142] Musk stated that his purchase of Twitter was part of his ambition to create an \"everything app\" called X, which would offer many different services.[143] In response, McCormick asked both sides to propose to her how they should proceed. Twitter shares surged by 23 percent as a result of Musk's announcement.[142] Neither Twitter nor Musk responded to McCormick's request, prompting her to announce that the trial would go forward as planned.[144]  On October 6, McCormick agreed to a request by Musk to postpone the trial to October 28 so Musk could finalize his debt financing for the acquisition, adding that the trial would be rescheduled to November if the deal did not close by then.", "April 25 – Twitter accepts Musk's offer to acquire the company and values the deal at $44 billion, according to an announcement from the company.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number.

By Matthew Futterman Reporting from Melbourne, Australia Aryna Sabalenka is no longer afraid of big stages. Overcoming a history of buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women’s singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka’s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka’s career — a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer.

In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets.

It was held at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, from 28 May to 11 June 2023, comprising singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair tournaments were also played.   It was the 127th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event of 2023.  As a Grand Slam tournament, the points for the French Open are the highest of all ATP and WTA tournaments.[1] These points determine the world ATP and WTA rankings for men's and women's competition, respectively. In both singles and doubles, women received slightly higher point totals compared to their male counterparts at each round of the tournament, except for the first and last.[1][2] Points and rankings for the wheelchair events fall under the jurisdiction of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour, which also places Grand Slams as the highest classification.[3]  Below is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event:[4][5]  The French Open total prize money for 2023 is €49,600,000, an increase of 12.3% compared to 2022.", "Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Novak Djokovic captured the 2023 French Open trophy by defeating Casper Ruud 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, 6-5 in the final, and he has now made Grand Slam history. The Serbian star has reached 23 major titles, passing Rafael Nadal for the men's record. Djokovic laid on the ground for a few seconds after his win, then stood up and took in the Roland Garros crowd -- one that included plenty of celebrities including Tom Brady, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Kylian Mbappe. \"I was a 7-year-old dreaming that I could win Wimbledon and become No. 1 in the world one day,\" Djokovic said after the match. \"I'm beyond grateful and blessed to be standing here with so many incredible achievements. \"One thing is for sure I feel I had the power to create my own destiny. I try to visualize every single thing in my life, and not only believe it but really feel it with every cell in my body.", "Djokovic is 4-0 against Ruud, and the two last met in the 2022 Nitto ATP Finals in Italy, with the Serbian claiming a 7-5, 6-3 victory. Djokovic can become the top-ranked men's player in the world with a win over Ruud in the French Open men's final on Sunday.  Sunday's French Open final is the opportunity Djokovic has been waiting for. The Serbian can break a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most men's Grand Slam singles titles in history by claiming his 23rd major championship at Roland Garros on Sunday against Ruud. Djokovic can also become the first man to win every major—Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open—at least three times. Additionally, a French Open victory would put him one step closer to sweeping the major tournaments this year, having also defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open in January. Only two men have won all four Grand Slam titles in the same year—Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver, who accomplished the feat in 1962 and 1969. Djokovic previously won the French Open in 2016 and 2021. He has found the most success at the Australian Open, where he is a 10-time champion, and is considered one of the greatest hard-court players in the Open era with 13 hard-court major titles.", "Had Alcaraz not dealt with cramping in his leg on Friday, it's worth wondering whether he would have given Djokovic a better run for his money. The Spaniard is widely believed to be the next big thing in men's tennis, and he already has one Grand Slam title to his name as a 20-year-old, winning the 2022 U.S. Open by defeating Ruud. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open when he was just 19 years old, becoming the first male player to win a Grand Slam as a teenager since Nadal accomplished the feat at Roland Garros in 2005. Additionally, Alcaraz has won 10 ATP Tour men's singles titles, which includes the 2022 U.S. Open and four Masters 1000 titles. Two of his Masters 1000 titles came in the Madrid Open, while the others came in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami Open. Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, is only just getting started, and tennis fans around the globe are in for a treat once he hits his prime.  Back in the French Open final for the second straight year, Ruud should not be taken lightly entering Sunday despite having to go up against one of the greatest players of all time.", "🏆 Forever raising the bar 🏆@DjokerNole masters Casper Ruud 7-6(1), 6-3, 7-5 to win a third Roland-Garros title and an unprecedented 23rd Grand Slam men’s singles title.⁰#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/9IfTi39alB Djokovic had tied Nadal on the Grand Slam list earlier this year after winning his 10th Australian Open. He is now tied with Serena Williams among men and women, and is just one shy of the overall record of 24 Grand Slam titles set by Margaret Court. \"I just want to send a message out there to every young person. Be in the present moment, forget about what happened in the past,\" Djokovic said. \"The future is something that is just going to happen. If you want a better future, you create it.\"  Many congrats on this amazing achievement @DjokerNole 23 is a number that just a few years back was imposible to think about, and you made it! Enjoy it with your family and team! 👏🏻 This was Djokovic's third French Open trophy, meaning he is now the only man to win all four Grand Slams at least three times. This also means he is retaking his spot as the No. 1 player in the world.", "Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 2-3 Ruud* Another disgraceful forehand from Djokovic, again into that backhand corner, gets him 15-all, then as Ruud comes in at 40-30, he pastes a pass past him, flat and cross court on the forehand. Ruud, though, again hangs in there, making advantage and closing out with an ace. “As a Federer fan through and through,” writes Yogesh P, “I’m reluctantly on board with the fact that he does not have the best shout at being the GOAT. The arguments for Djokovic are straightforward. The argument for Nadal is also quite compelling though. If there is one achievement of these big three that is least likely to be repeated in the future, it is Nadal’s dominance of clay. Even the Grand Slam total can arguably be overcome in a weak competitive environment.” Yes, and Nadal is better on clay than anyone else has been on any one surface – not something I thought I’d ever say when watching Sampras on grass – but I don’t think that’s a good metric because there are other surfaces.", "The 2023 French Open at Roland Garros is nearing an end, but the men's semifinals on Friday delivered two riveting matches with spots in Sunday's final on the line. Novak Djokovic and 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz kicked off Friday's action with a grueling match. After Djokovic claimed the first set 6-3, Alcaraz battled to a 7-5 victory in the second set before cramping in his leg limited his power and mobility in the final two sets of the match. The ailment was something the world No. 1 was unable to overcome, and Djokovic went on to claim a 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Spaniard for his ninth victory in his last 10 matches dating back to the Rome Masters last month. The second match of Friday's semifinals saw world No. 4 Casper Ruud defeat German Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. Ruud, who reached the semifinals of the Rome Masters last month, appears to be in peak form heading into Sunday's final. Djokovic, ranked No. 3 in the world, and Ruud will now meet for the fifth time in their careers.", "The first set was tight until 6-all, and then Djokovic simply took over, dominating the tiebreaker — as he often does — and the second set, before grabbing 12 of the last 13 points to seal the victory. That allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors. Federer, who announced his retirement last year, is next among men with 20, while Djokovic’s idol, Pete Sampras, is fourth with 14. And to think: Sampras set that mark by winning his last Slam in what turned out to be the last match of his career, the 2002 U.S. Open final. Here we are, just 21 years later, and not only did three guys surpass Sampras, but Djokovic moved way past him. Serena Williams finished her career last year with 23 majors, the most for a woman in the Open era. Margaret Court won 24, some during the amateur era. Djokovic’s win also moved back into the top spot of the ATP rankings, jumping from No. 3 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1. Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the semifinals. The women’s singles title in Paris was won on Saturday by Iga Swiatek, who defeated Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.", "Novak Djokovic defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–5 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2023 French Open. It was his third French Open title and his record-breaking 23rd men's singles major title overall, surpassing the record he previously held jointly with Rafael Nadal.[1] With the victory, Djokovic became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.[2]  Nadal was the reigning champion,[3] but withdrew due to a left hip injury. This was the first time the 14-time champion missed the tournament since his debut in 2005.[4] With his withdrawal, Nadal fell out of the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time since 2003.[5]  By winning the title, Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 singles ranking from Carlos Alcaraz; Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top ranking at the beginning of the tournament.[6][7] Medvedev's loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild in the first round marked the first time since 2000 that the second seed (then Pete Sampras) lost in the opening round."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week.

And with help from a series of shanked shots by a tight-looking Ruud in the ensuing tiebreaker, Alcaraz surged to the end of that set. One break in the fourth was all it took for Alcaraz to seal the victory in the only Grand Slam final between two players seeking both a first major championship and the top spot in the ATP's computerized rankings, which date to 1973. Ruud is a 23-year-old from Norway who is now 0-2 in Slam finals. He was the runner-up to Rafael Nadal at the French Open in June. Ruud stood way back near the wall to return serve, but also during the course of points, much more so than Alcaraz, who attacked when he could. Alcaraz went after Ruud's weaker side, the backhand, and found success that way, especially while serving.

Look, no one is fooling anyone. If someone said upon the prior regime departing, that Brent Pry was going to be the head coach of the 2022 and beyond (however long “beyond is”) Virginia Tech Hokies football program, you’d have been laughed out of the room. Who? For Defensive Coordinator, maybe? And why would he take that demotion? The reality (again we return to “reality”) is that only two or three coaches on this staff have experience at the levels at which they are performing; JC Price and Joe Rudolph are performing parallel jobs. Everyone else is subject to the “Peter Principle”. I don’t normally sight Wikipedia but this works fine. That includes the Head Coach, the Offensive Coordinator, the Defensive Coordinator, and the Special Teams Coach. Well, gee isn’t that really everyone who counts. That’s an affirmative. Another “reality” is called for, here. Whit Babcock is taking a very calculated risk. He did the “safe” and expected thing before and was burned. This time he’s gone ahead and dived into the tank headfirst without testing the water. At mid-season of the first year, it’s not expected that very much will be done until after December, but there are indications that some of the subjects are perilously close to the operational disaster outlined in the definition of the “Peter Principle”.", "The situation as of December 31, 2021, within the Hokie coaching staff offices was largely the chaos of people packing boxes and moving out. The New Era Pinstripe Bowl appearance, though a grace of some measure was probably more of a curse since it might have been better just walking away from the entire mess of the last three seasons and spending some serious “reflection time” sorting it out. The team that took the field in Yankee Stadium was stripped of major players either by choice or circumstance.  Connor Blumrick was brave and had a winning attitude to finish out the season with largely nothing more than three Read-Option running plays and a couple of pass plays that he’d managed to practice enough to not just look like another running back behind the center. The loss to Maryland in that bowl had to have been one of the lowest points in the locker room since the massive loss to Duke, at home a couple of years earlier. It was for entirely different reasons, but this one was the reality that the team had no offense, and no head coach.  The irony is that the new Offensive Coordinator picked by the new Head Coach got his coaching start at Maryland. It’s only been 12 years since Tyler Bowen - Football Coach - Virginia Tech Athletics (hokiesports.com) was a graduate assistant there. About a third of that time was at the FCS level.", "64  BLACKSBURG, Va. — Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn’t cutting it, nor were some of the players. It’s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry, chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans: This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t in a quick-fix situation.", "The 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente’s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "“I’ve always heard good things about Brent. … Good energy. Cares about the players. And obviously a good track record at Penn State. So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.", "Beamer remains extremely visible, often walking around campus engaging with fans and students. Pry has put himself out there as well in a bid to reignite a fan base that had grown weary amid losing records over the past few years. The Hokies finished below .500 in each of the previous two seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992, when Beamer was in the early stages of constructing the program. Almost immediately after his hiring, Pry seized upon the winning tradition Beamer had put in place over his Hall of Fame career, telling his charges during his first team meeting that they didn’t come to Virginia Tech to go 6-7. Players since have recalled that introduction to Pry as inspiration for this season and beyond. “That’s kind of the first thing that bridged the gap for us as players with a new coach,” wide receiver Kaleb Smith said. “Having somebody who knows the Virginia Tech traditions, knows what it means to be a Hokie — because that’s something we all share and hold deep in our hearts.” The unbridled enthusiasm Pry brings to the job surfaced during his opening remarks Thursday, when he paused to look at his cellphone and revealed Virginia Tech had just added another commitment. Pry, wearing a suit and tie in Hokies colors, then turned to the three players who accompanied him to the event and told them, “Virginia Tech just got better.", "The starting point was the 2007-2010 recruiting runs that couldn’t net a replacement for Tyrod Taylor behind center. There were flashes of good but the best post-Taylor Quarterback, Michael Brewer was handicapped by injury, and a team in decline as the running game evaporated, and the offensive line recruiting dropped to piecemeal replacements.  Suffice it to say by the late Beamer Era the team was sliding downhill rapidly. Whit Babcock, in a move that didn’t shock anyone after his basketball coaching coup (of the time) with the Buzz hire, went out and found the best available head coach by media and analyst agreement in Justin Fuente. We know how that turned out… a brilliant 2 season flash followed by a fading ember and a huge bill for the displeasure of having to part company with a failed regime.  Face it, as reported third coaching choice Brent Pry signed his contract to take over as head coach, the Virginia Tech Hokie football program was all show and no go. Regardless of the level of Pry’s enthusiasm he was taking on a leaking hulk with a great paintjob. The indications are that he knew and understood that challenge. The Hokies just haven’t been very good for over a decade and getting over that slump was just not going to be a very easy task, especially for a program that can only generate revenues well below even modest programs.", "The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed.", "The 2022 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Tech during the 2022 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hokies were led by first-year head coach Brent Pry. They played their home games at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).  The Hokies finished the 2021 season 6–7, 4–4 in ACC play to finish in a tie for third place in the Coastal division.[1] They received an invitation to the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl where they lost to Maryland 54–10.[2]  On November 16, 2021, the school fired head coach Justin Fuente after six years as head coach.[3] Assistant coach J.

The crypto conference took place June 9–12 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.  Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia — the Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. “New York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.” Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices. Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful — a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace — told Cointelegraph that crypto winters allow for building phases to start, which he fully supports. “We are now seeing projects build platforms that are real and empowering.", "Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the bipartisan bill is “terrific,” further noting that the bill contains modest differences in how stablecoins are treated compared with his stablecoin approach, which was drafted in April this year. Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "However, no rules have been revealed yet, so we don’t know what this will look like.” Moreover, Long predicts that stablecoins will be a main focus for regulators, pointing out that Wyoming’s special purpose depository regime falls into this category, alongside The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) regulatory guidance for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by DFS-regulated entities. Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Radio coverage is available through Sirius XM Channel 85.", "Here’s a look at the now-18-horse field, plus its starting positions and morning-line odds: Practical Move (elevated temperature), Lord Miles (trainer suspension), Continuar (fitness concerns), Skinner (elevated temperature) and Forte (fitness concerns) were all removed from the original lineup. All three also-eligible horses have entered the lineup, so any additional scratches will reduce the field’s size even further. Due to the scratches, the field’s newly added horses — Cyclone Mischief, Mandarin Hero and King Russell — will respectively break from posts No. 16, 17 and 18, though their program numbers will respectively remain No. 21, 22 and 23. Before getting scratched, Forte was the overwhelming favorite to win the race with 3-1 morning-line odds. Fitness concerns forced the horse to withdraw from the race Saturday morning. Now, Tapit Trice (5-1) and Pennsylvania-hailing Angel of Empire (8-1) have the shortest odds to win the derby, according to the morning-line odds. Over the years, clear-cut favorites have won the Kentucky Derby 40 times out of 115 contested races, translating to a 34.78% winning rate. Most recently, the race-time favorite won each race between 2013 and 2018. However, the Kentucky Derby’s favorite did not win the race once between 1980 and 1999.", "White Abarrio had a 4–0–1 record in five lifetime starts, including a first-place finish in the Florida Derby.[31] Messier drew the sixth post before the race, with Taiba drawing twelfth and White Abarrio fifteenth.[32]  If any of the 20 Derby entries is withdrawn from the race before betting begins, the next-highest ranked horse on the leaderboard draws into their place.[32] On the day before the race, Ethereal Road, who was set to race from the 20th post, was scratched from the Derby. Rich Strike drew into the Derby as a result of the scratch. He had a record of 1–0–3 in seven lifetime starts and earned his qualifying points by finishing in third place at the Jeff Ruby Steaks.[33] His only win came in a maiden claiming race on September 17, 2021.[34]  The Kentucky Derby takes place annually at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on the first Saturday in May, where it began in 1875. Participating horses run a distance of 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km), or 10 furlongs.[6] The Derby is a Grade I event with a purse of $3,000,000 in 2022.[35] Predicted rain and thunderstorms in Louisville, Kentucky suggested that the Derby could be raced in muddy or sloppy conditions.", "— you have to go back to a Native American tribe in northern New Jersey called the Minisi. They lived in an area called Pra-qua-les, which translates to quail woods for what is probably an obvious reason. As if playing a game of “telephone” a couple centuries before there was such a device, the locals eventually made the word Preakness. Fast forward a century or so and thoroughbred owner Milton H. Sanford took to the name and called his two farms Preakness, one in Kentucky and one in New Jersey. The Garden State location in Passaic County is now called the unincorporated town of Preakness. Legend has it that a bunch of blue bloods in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., were sitting around a pre-Gilded Age dinner in 1868 and wanted to come up with a race that would be run in two years in Baltimore. They named it … wait … The Dinner Party Stakes. Yes, we’ll get to the part about the horse. Meanwhile, Sanford bought a colt by Lexington and out of Bay Leaf for $2,000 and called him Preakness and his first race was to be in the Dinner Party Stakes on opening day at Pimlico Race Course. Foster was the heavy favorite in the race, but Preakness was the shocking winner, just holding on for the victory.", "The 2023 Kentucky Derby is near. Its rich history, the high stakes, and its stature has made it one of the most prestigious horse races in the world. This importance makes the whole day an event in itself, with a number of traditions and festivities leading up to the race itself, starting two weeks before the race, with the Kentucky Derby Festival. The day starts with a “dawn patrol”, where the horses that will be racing are taken out for a morning workout. During this routine, the trainers and owners have a chance to see how their horses are feeling and make any last-minute adjustments to their strategy. A few races precede the Kentucky Derby, which is run in the late afternoon with the horses parading onto the track to the sound of “My Old Kentucky Home”, the state anthem. The race itself is short, only lasting around two minutes, which is the reason why the race is known as “The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports”. Once the race ends, the winner is draped in a blanket of roses and presented with the coveted Kentucky Derby trophy. The purse, or prize, for the race will be $3 million. The 2023 Kentucky Derby will take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023.

The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.  The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history.

Tesla generates its revenues from three segments: automotive sales, energy generation & storage, and services. In Q2 2022, the revenue from Automotive sales stood at $14,602 million (a 13% decline quarter-over-quarter), Energy generation and storage generated $866 million (a 32% decline quarter-over-quarter) in revenues, and revenues from the services segment amounted to $1,466 million (a 138% increase quarter-over-quarter). Tesla generates the majority of its revenues from its automotive business. In 2021, Tesla produced a total of 930,422 vehicles and delivered 936,222 vehicles. Automotive sales:  The automotive segment includes manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Automotive sales include production and deliveries of Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot or FSD features, and over-the-air software updates. These vehicle deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.  Automotive regulatory credits include sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers.

(TSLA) reported Q1 FY 2022 earnings results that surpassed analysts' expectations. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) beat estimates, rising 246.2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenue also came in above analyst forecasts, rising 80.5% year over year (YOY). Revenue growth was driven by vehicle deliveries, increased average selling prices, and growth in other areas of the company's business. Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles in the quarter, which it reported earlier in the month and which came in below analysts' forecasts.   The company's shares rose more than 4% in extended trading. Over the past year, Tesla's shares have provided a total return of 35.8%, below the S&P 500's total return of 7.9%.   The number of vehicles produced by Tesla rose 69.4% YOY. Tesla's primary business is making electric vehicles, and it needs to continue expanding production in order to grow revenue and profits.

Automotive gross margins jumped to a record 32.9% with Tesla reporting gross profit of $5.54 billion in its main segment. Regulatory credits accounted for $679 million of automotive revenue for the quarter. Revenue growth was driven in part by an increase in the number of cars Tesla delivered, and an increase in average sales prices, the company said in its shareholder deck.", "Shares of the company are up around 4% in after-hours trading, after shedding nearly 5% of their value during regular trading. The company’s quarter is hard to fault. Revenues at Tesla rose 81% on a year-over-year basis, a figure bested by 87% growth in automotive revenues across a similar time frame. Even more, the company’s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin — that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period. While Tesla’s overall figures were strong in the quarter when compared to expectations, it was the company’s automotive business that stood out.  In contrast, Tesla’s “energy generation and storage” revenues, which combines energy storage and solar, came to $616 million — slimmer than what it managed in quarters two, three and four in 2021. The company did beat its year-ago energy and storage top line result of $494 million, however.

The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents.  Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company’s profit result stands out as it is by far the company’s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results.

Najafi’s rescue came at a time when STX was facing a deadline to repay $127M in debt. Separately, a Lionsgate and STX spokesperson declined to comment. Variety first had the news about Lionsgate’s serious kicking of the tires of STX. STX launched with the 2015 Joel Edgerton directed horror movie The Gift in 2015. Initially, the studio’s plan was to make movies for the underserved adult audience which could cross over, and at lesser cost than major studios. That planned worked for a bit with Hustlers and Bad Moms ($314.4M from two films worldwide) before STX faced the headwinds of the pandemic. They pivoted sending their theatrical titles sooner to PVOD and selling off streaming rights, i.e. Gerard Butler’s Greenland going to HBO Max for $20M-$30M and Kristen Bell comedy Queenpins to Paramount+ for twice the film’s $10 million cost. The company had withdrawn a planned IPO in Hong Kong in 2018, citing market conditions, a move that deprived it of much-needed resources. Despite the success of Hustlers, a quest for a new financial structure led the studio into the arms of Eros in 2020, a company which ultimately wound up being in financial peril.", "By Anthony D'Alessandro  Editorial Director/Box Office Editor Lionsgate is looking to absorb part of, or all of STX Entertainment, Deadline has learned from sources. STX was recently rescued back in early December from a draconian merger with Eros by Jahm Najafi’s Phoenix-based The Najafi Companies for $173M. As Deadline first reported, that move by Najafi was an interim step on the way to a later, possibly bigger, transaction. It sounds like, Lionsgate is it. A key element of the agreement then was a “go-shop period,” a 45-day span during which the board of directors of ErosSTX, with the assistance of its financial advisor, Lazard, could solicit alternative proposals from third parties. Reportedly there are other suitors in the mix for the STX assets which include Jennifer Lopez’s highest grossing live-action domestic movie, Hustlers ($105M) and the Bad Moms comedy franchise.              \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tAcquisitions \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternational Insider: Lionsgate Buys eOne; On Location, Location, Locarno; Anger In Israel; Barbie Keeps Soaring\t\t \t\t\t                \tExecutives \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tEntertainment One's Steve Bertram Reflects On \"Incredible Ride\" As He & Michael Lombardo Set Exits Following Lionsgate Acquisition", "It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences.[7] The Wall Street Journal stated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.[7][8] In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[9]  STX called off its IPO in October 2018, citing the China–U.S. trade war, and conditions having deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in the mainland Chinese equity market.[10]  An overall co-funding agreement with Chinese company Huayi Brothers Media lapsed at the end of 2018,[11] and in April 2019, co-founder Bill McGlashan was fired due to his being indicted in the college admissions bribery scandal.[12]  In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian film and television studio Eros International plc.

Founded in March 2014 by film producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.  In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]  In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global.

Eros Media World will retain a 15% non-voting stake in the company.[21][22] In July 2022, shortly after STX's motion picture chairman Adam Fogelson departed for the studio, Deadline reported that STX was in talks with Lionsgate over a potential film distribution deal.[23] Shortly after, it was reported that STX Entertainment's U.K. offices, including the London office housing STXinternational's headquarters, were gradually shutting down.[24] Following the departure of STXinternational head John Friedberg to join Black Bear Pictures' international division, it was announced the latter company was nearing a deal with STX to handle part of its slate internationally."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Together, we will double-down on what’s working well and quickly eliminate what’s not.   I know you have a lot of questions. Perhaps the biggest one is how will CNN change? The honest answer is that I don’t know yet. David Zaslav has given me one simple directive: To ensure that CNN remains the global leader in NEWS as part of Warner Bros. Discovery.   I am a journalist at heart. While I have enjoyed every minute at “The Late Show,” I am joining CNN because I feel a genuine pull to return to news at such a critical moment in history. CNN is uniquely positioned to be a beacon of meaningful, impactful journalism for the world. I am committed to upholding and building on CNN’s legacy.

Polls conducted after the debate to ascertain which candidate performed best, showed that 59% of viewers thought that Macron had performed better, compared to 39% for Le Pen.[74][75]  The trendlines below are constructed using local regressions.[76]      Macron was re-elected with 58.55% of the vote to 41.45% for Le Pen in the second round of the election.[77] Exit poll projections by Ipsos and Sopra Steria for France Télévisions and Radio France, released as voting closed, estimated that Macron defeated Le Pen with 58.2% of the vote to 41.8%.[78] He became the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac in 2002.", "Le Pen called her result “a shining victory,” saying that “in this defeat, I can’t help but feel a form of hope.”  Breaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right. Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac. She and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France’s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron. Le Pen’s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.  Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.” The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.", "“This will be my responsibility.” At Le Pen’s election night event, at a Parisian park pavilion, the release of projected results provoked a mix of boos and solemn silence. But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced “two weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods” to prevent her win, and she said that “tonight’s result represents in itself a resounding victory.” Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France’s presidential election runoff Sunday’s result marked the far right’s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "She is sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin and skeptical of NATO and the European Union. Le Pen conceded defeat in a speech to supporters shortly after the projections were released but said her unprecedented vote total represented “a shining victory in itself.” “The ideas we represent are reaching summits,” she said. After polls closed across France at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the polling companies Opinionway, Harris and IFOP worked with media organizations to publish projected results based on early voting patterns. The interior ministry announced the final results Monday, with Macron winning 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5 percent. The campaign was beset by apathy, with many voters dissatisfied with both candidates and the turnout looking likely to be around 2 points lower than it was five years ago.  Politicians across the political spectrum will also likely reflect on the huge number of abstentions, which reached a record 28 percent of the electorate. But ultimately Macron, 44, has won a clear victory that surpassed his polling numbers, surging in the final stages to earn five more years at the helm of one of the continent's two major powers.

While arguably, a quad-bayer sensor should not give true 48-megapixel sensor resolution as one might get from, say, a comparable ‘proper’ digital camera, the results out of the iPhone 14 Pro gave me chills. I have simply never gotten image quality like this out of a phone. There’s more here than just resolution; the way the new 48 megapixel sensor renders the image is unique and simply tremendously different than what I’ve seen before. These photos were all shot in Apple’s ProRAW format and further developed in Lightroom or other image editors like Apple’s own Photos app. I was very impressed with the latitude of these files; I tend to expose my image for the highlights, shooting intentionally dark to boost shadows later, and these files have plenty of shadow information to do just that:  Detail-wise, we can see quite easily that it’s an incredible leap on previous iPhones, including the iPhone 13 Pro: It helps that Bhutan is essentially a camera test chart, with near-infinite levels of detail in their decorations to pixel-peep: Comparing to the iPhone 13 Pro, the comparison seems downright unfair.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.", "The trick comes in sensing color; to get that in a shot, sensors have colored red, blue and green lenses on these tiny pixels.  Every group of this mosaic of ‘sub-pixels’ can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro’s sensors look like this: Every ‘pixel’ essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro’s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally ‘mosaicked’ pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as ‘Quad Bayer’.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to ‘de-mosaic’ this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four ‘super subpixels’ of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Lux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations. At a now-legendary keynote, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was launching a widescreen iPod, a phone and an internet communications device. These three devices were not separate new products, he revealed — they were all functions of a revolutionary new device: the iPhone. If introduced today, we’d find a conspicuous absence in that lineup: a groundbreaking new camera. It was not one of the devices he mentioned, and for good reason: The iPhone launched with a 2-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter. There was no pretense about this replacing your camera for taking photos.  Fast forward to today, and the main feature-point of most smartphone launches is, of course, their cameras. Plural. In the time since the iPhone launched, it has gone through small steps and big leaps and from a single fixed-focus camera to an entire complex array of cameras.  Evolution. #iPhone14 pic.twitter.com/8A7JUTQdcl With iPhone 14 Pro, Apple has made a huge change to its entire camera system — and yet, it seems many reviewers and publications cannot agree on whether it is a small step or a huge leap.  At Lux, we make a camera app. We have been taking thousands of iPhone photos every month since we launched our app five years ago, and we know a thing or two about smartphone cameras.", "Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm², is almost 50% larger than the iPhone 13 Pro’s 26.9 mm² sensor. While its aperture is slightly ‘slower’ (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can’t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple’s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The ‘my point of view’ perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect? Well, comparably, with the main camera getting ever-better, it is still fairly soft and lacking detail. Its 12 megapixel resolution is suddenly feeling almost restrictive.", "iPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode. This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.", "This is our deep dive into iPhone 14 Pro — not the phone, the iPod, or the internet communicator — but the camera.  We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone’s eye first was the opener of Apple’s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone’s recognizable screen cutout or ‘notch’ had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic ‘island’. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What’s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul.", "With iPhone 14 Pro, we’re entering the 48 megapixel era of iPhone photography. If it was mere detail or pixels, it would mark a step towards the cameras from the Radio Shack ad.  But what Apple has delivered in the iPhone 14 Pro is a camera that performs in all ways closer to a ‘proper’ camera than any phone ever has. At times, it can capture images that truly render unlike a phone camera — instead, they are what I would consider a real photo, not from a phone, but from a camera.

The thing you should understand about Apple’s home repair process is that it’s a far cry from traditional DIY if you opt for the kit — which I did, once I saw the repair manual only contains instructions for Apple’s own tools. (You can just buy a battery if you want.) I expected Apple would send me a small box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers; I own a mini iPhone, after all. Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started. Step one of opening an iPhone is, basically, using a hefty machine to suck the screen off the top. Here, I wasn’t microwaving a jelly-filled sock to loosen the Apple goop holding my screen down! Apple lets you rent an industrial-grade heat station that looks like a piece of lab equipment, right down to the big red safety dial you twist to release the emergency-off button and the suction-cup-tipped mechanical lifting arm. It looks pretty cool.", "Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall. It’s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.", "Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\rHowever, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit —  the smallest kit available —  then the kit's contents are worth around $914. For all other iPhone models available, the second case adds about $364, for a total on your credit card of $1,278.\rNote that the kit costs the same, and has the same tools, whether you want the tools to replace a battery or fix the speaker. So if you're on a low income, a tight budget, and figured this was a way to fix your iPhone cheaply, then it probably isn't.\rIt's also not in any possible way a straightforward job. And if the severe warnings throughout the documentation don't put you off, the toolkit cases might.\rThe iPhone SE toolkit comes in one case, where all of the other iPhones in the program get a two-case kit instead. The case you get for the iPhone SE contains:\rBattery press Display Press 4.7-inch Repair Tray Adhesive Cutter Nylon Probe (Black Stick) 4.7-inch Display Protective Cover 4.7-inch Back Protective Cover Black Torque Driver Kit Gray Torque Driver", "For the review, Barbera first explained that he is not a skilled repairman and purchased parts for a battery replacement for his iPhone 12 mini, along with the tool kit. After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.", "Green Torque Driver Blue Torque Driver Micro Stix Bit Super screw Bit 4.7-inch Support Frame Universal Display Fixture Every iPhone repair toolkit, regardless of the model, comes with a case containing these tools.

The Apple self repair kits were intended to be a more cost effective alternative for device repairs, however, the home repair kit may end up being even more expensive than manufacturer repair.  MacRumors recently published a review of Apple’s new self repair kit, where Dan Barbera, the site’s videographer, purchased the kit himself and gave his feedback via a YouTube video. For starters, the Apple Self Service Repair Store website only sells parts and tools for the iPhone, and only for the iPhone 12 model and newer.  Depending on what part of the phone you are trying to repair, different parts and tools are available, varying in price. The website also gives you the option to rent the repair kit with all the tools required or to purchase the tools separately based on user needs.  If users choose to rent the kit, they will actually be renting two large kits weighing 43 pounds and 36 pounds for $49. However, the rental period is only 7 days, and a temporary authorization is placed on your account in case you fail to return the kit by the end of the rental period. If a customer fails to return the kit, they will be charged $1,300.", "Unless you want to cheat and use the cases’ wheels, which I’m thrilled to report don’t cost $700 extra. What’s inside these beefy kits? The first case for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 repairs includes a “Heated Display Removal Fixture” and a “Heated Display Pocket,” a pair of technical devices that would cost roughly $350 to buy separately. In the other case are various parts, including battery and display presses, a repair tray, torque drivers, screw bits, and adhesive covers. You can find a full list in the Q&A section of the Tool Kit Rental page.  But what if I just need one torque driver, and I don’t want to buy it to keep? I guess I’ll have to hit the gym so I can carry all of that extra gear. In all seriousness, I’m eager to see what’s included in the rental kits for Mac repairs once Apple adds laptops and desktops to its self-service repair program later this year. Heft aside, the rental service seems like a legitimately great way to save money on genuine components most people don’t have in their toolbox. If only you could rent just the specific tools you need individually, too. And if only Apple’s new right-to-repair initiative supported older iPhone models—you know, the ones most in need of repairs or replacement parts.", "Now it's launched the program, it can tell any court in the land that it is providing every possible tool —  and doing so for a $49/week rental fee, including shipping.\r Only, that isn't $49 per week for however long you need to study the 80+ pages of repair manuals available on the new service site.

The 2022 Met Gala theme is \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with the dress code being gilded glamour and white tie. Channeling the time period between 1870 to 1890, the event \"will ask its attendees to embody the grandeur—and perhaps the dichotomy—of Gilded Age New York,\" per Vogue.   The era is known for major industrialization and put the likes of John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, and Cornelius Vanderbilt on the map. Unprecedented prosperity and cultural change were significant. The light bulb was patented, the telephone was invented, wages skyrocketed — and seemingly instantaneous, so did skyscrapers and fortunes.

So one of the main intentions of the exhibition is to spotlight the talents and contributions of these individuals, and many of them are women.” On 17 March, Vogue announced that its 2022 hosts would include Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lin-Manuel Miranda will serve as the night’s official co-chairs, while designer Tom Ford, Instagram’s Adam Mosseri, and Vogue’s Anna Wintour will continue as honorary co-chairs.

The first, In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, opened on 18 September, and was preceded by the 2021 Met Gala on 13 September.  The theme for part two is In America: An Anthology of Fashion, and the exhibition will see Andrew Bolton, head curator of the Museum of Modern Art’s Costume Institute, focus on inclusivity in fashion. “Who gets to be American?” was a question posed at Prabal Gurung’s spring/summer 2020 show, and it will be addressed at the Met Gala 2022, too.", "\"I'm hoping that this sculpture will be a reflective moment and allow us to think about what these symbols mean to us in a personal way,\" Valentino told Vogue in 2022. In 2022, celebrity attendees were greeted by a string orchestra, as pictured above. Photos from inside the event showed celebrities posing in front of the staircase. For the Met Gala in 2019, the grand staircase was flanked by wall-to-wall installations of pink feathers to celebrate the night's \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" theme. The decorations change from year to year. Last year, the decorations heavily featured red flowers and roses. Wintour also serves as the night's host. Earlier this year, reports emerged that the guest list would be slimmed down for the 2023 Met Gala, though Wintour herself never confirmed that to be the case. Inside the 2022 Met Gala, guests could be seen milling about from table to table in front of large projection screens. There was also a stage set up for live performances. \"We start with a seating document when the names come together in December,\" Kiernan told Vogue ahead of the 2023 Met Gala. \"The actual seating chart doesn't come together until about a month before the event, when we get a sense for the layout of the room, and the flow of the evening.\" The dinner itself for fashion's biggest night is curated by renowned chefs.", "The entertainment outlet will also host red carpet coverage on \"Live from E!\" beginning at 6 p.m. ET.   For the gala itself, attendees will be asked to dress in white tie and \"gilded glamour,\" referring to late 1800s America that was led by industrialization and innovation.

Even with an initial release now locked in, the exact rollout is still muddled.", "Overwatch 2 is a 2022 first-person shooter game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. As a sequel and replacement to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while initially having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes, though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.  Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.  The original Overwatch was designed for six-on-six team combat, with two of each class on a team.", "Overwatch 2.

This is only the PvP portion of the game, and it will be early access at launch. PvE is scheduled to arrive at some point in 2023.   Overwatch 2. Credit: Blizzard Way back at BlizzCon 2019, Blizzard revealed that Overwatch 2 was still early in development and that no firm release date was planned. “I don’t know. I have no idea,” former game director Jeff Kaplan said at the reveal panel when asked when the game would arrive. “Like, just let us make it great, that’s what we care about more than anything. We don’t have a date in mind.” Back then, it was largely assumed the game would land in 2021 – there was a playable vertical slice at BlizzCon 2019, after all – but recent events within Activision Blizzard eliminated any chance of the game launching soon. In a February 2021 financial call Activision Blizzard CFO, Dennis Durkin, said the company’s outlook “does not include” Overwatch 2 releasing in 2021.", "The company plans to share more about Overwatch 2 in a “reveal event” livestream that takes place in just a few days — you can watch it on June 16th at 1PM ET. Blizzard first announced Overwatch 2 in 2019, but it really only began showing the game in earnest over the past few months, including with a closed beta. The company has split the development of the PVP and PVE parts of the game. While the PVP element will be available October 4, we still don’t know when the PVE portion will be available. Microsoft is set to acquire Activision Blizzard in a deal worth nearly $70 billion, though the acquisition isn’t expected to close until Microsoft’s fiscal year 2023, which begins in July.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

This would allow them to also continue to support Overwatch alongside Overwatch 2's development.[26][27] Later, Blizzard announced that the first wave of Overwatch 2 invitation-only betas would begin on April 26, 2022, and end on May 17. Access to the closed beta could be earned either by signing up for a chance to participate or by watching select Twitch streamers for a limited time on April 27.[28][29]  The game without its PvE mode was released as early access on October 4, 2022, for Windows, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.", "All you need to know about the arrival of Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has finally landed, following the original Overwatch shutting down. The highly anticipated sequel has brought significant changes to the game, including a free-to-play model, a sizeable team update, a whole bunch of new heroes, and much more. Those who pre-loaded the game will have already got themselves well acquainted with the new and improved features, but if you're only just getting that battle pass loaded, or want to gain a better understanding of just how you can make the most of Overwatch 2, read on. The Overwatch 2 release date was 4th October 2o22, as developers confirmed well in advance. Although the game is free-to-play, players also have the option to buy the Watchpoint Pack for £34.99 - it's available on the Xbox, PlayStation and Battle.net websites - if they want to secure some special skins, in-game currency and more.

Twelve of the existing 31 redesigns were completed at the time of Overwatch 2's reveal.[17]  Overwatch 2 was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4, 2022.[18] Kaplan stated when the game was announced that they were more concerned about quality of the product than timeliness of the release.[19][20] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022 release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for \"giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch\".[21] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}
{"id": 83, "query": "Who won the 2022 Tour de France?", "ans": ["Jonas Vingegaard"], "label": [1], "prediction": "Based on the given external documents, it appears that Denmark's Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) won the 2022 Tour de France. He successfully held onto the yellow jersey as the overall leader of the tour and finished second on Stage 17. Slovenia's Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) finished third on the same stage and remains second overall, 2:18 behind Vingegaard. Great Britain's Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) finished third overall, 4:56 behind Vingegaard.", "docs": ["Two days in the Pyrenees down, one to go: Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) once again held on to the yellow jersey as the overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 17 in Peyragudes. Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) won the stage, outsprinting Vingegaard to win his third stage of this year’s Tour. Pogačar’s teammate, the United States’ Brendan McNulty, finished third after doing much of the work in the latter parts of the stage. Pogačar trimmed four seconds from Vingegaard’s lead thanks to the 10-second time bonus he earned for winning the stage. (Vingegaard took six seconds of his own by finishing second.) The Dane now leads the Slovenian by 2:18 on the Tour’s General Classification. Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) lost time to both riders, but remains third overall, 4:56 behind Vingegaard. Who’s Really Winning the Tour? Once again Vingegaard and Pogačar proved to be the two best riders in the 2022 Tour de France. Despite winning the stage, the long-range attacks that we expected from Pogačar never materialized.", "With the Pyrenees looming, the battle to win the 2022 Tour de France has been reduced to just two contenders, with Pogačar attacking and Vingegaard having no trouble following the Slovenian’s acceleration on the Côte de la Croix Neuve at the end of Stage 14. Behind them, the rest of the Tour’s general classification contenders all lost time. But while the time gaps between Pogačar-Vingegaard and the other contenders weren’t huge on the finish line in Mende, it’s clear that everyone else is racing for third–a boon to Vingegaard as Pogačar will likely find few allies willing to risk a possible podium place by attacking the yellow jersey in the final week.  Even better for Vingegaard and Jumbo-Visma is the fact that Pogačar and his team continue to make questionable decisions. The Slovenian launched a 200-meter sprint at the end of the stage–for no good reason–and the team put Spain’s Marc Soler in the day’s big breakaway, which might have made sense had the team not already lost two riders to COVID-19. If Pogačar is to win a third Tour de France, he’s going to need all the help he can get from his teammates, and allowing Soler to waste energy on a day like this might be something they later regret. Who’s Winning the Tour?", "So tomorrow, all eyes will be–again–on the Tour’s top-2 riders, with one day left for Vingegaard to solidify his lead before the time trial, and one day left for Pogačar to get close enough to give himself a chance of winning a third consecutive Tour de France. Who’s Winning the Tour? Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) survived the first of three days in the Pyrenees to hold on to the yellow jersey as the overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France. The 25-year-old finished safely in a small group of GC contenders and their teammates in Foix at the end of Stage 16, maintaining his 2:22 advantage over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates), the two-time defending champion. After getting gapped on the final climb of the stage, Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) managed to rejoin the group of favorites on the long road down to the finish. He remains third overall, 2:43 behind Vingegaard on the Tour’s General Classification. It was a bigger day for Canada and Israel-Premier-Tech, though as Canadian Hugo Houle won the stage and his teammate and compatriot, Michael Woods, finished third.", "Although the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primož Roglič wasn’t.  Maybe Roglič (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn’t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June’s Criterium du Dauphiné, the fact that he wasn’t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team’s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There’s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today’s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in Sønderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The Netherland’s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win since 2019.", "Pogačar remains the best all-around rider in the world, and with a little more tactical nous–and perhaps a bit more humility–he might get even better. Who Really Won the Tour? While INEOS-Grenadiers finished the Tour atop the Team’s Classification, Jumbo-Visma was the best team in the 2022 Tour de France. In addition to winning the yellow jersey, Vingegaard also won the polka dot jersey as the winner of the Tour’s King of the Mountains competition. His teammate, Belgium’s Wout van Aert, won the green jersey as the winner of the Tour’s Points Classification and was also named the Tour’s Most Aggressive Rider. Along the way the team won six stages: three with van Aert, two with Vingegaard, and one with France’s Cristophe Laporte. Perhaps even more impressive was the manner in which the team defended Vingegaard’s lead in the Pyrenees during the Tour’s third week. The team lost Slovenia’s Primož Roglič and the Netherlands’ Steven Kruijswijk on Stage 15, with Roglič not taking the start and Kruijswijk crashing out on the road to Carcassonne.", "With three days left in the 2022 Tour de France, Vingegaard looks assured of standing on the top step of the podium in Paris. Barring a crash, a mechanical, or a terrible ride in Saturday’s 40km individual time trial, the Dane’s lead is too much for Pogačar to overcome. Pogačar and Thomas look certain to stand next to Vingegaard on the Tour’s final podium. Thomas is one the Tour’s better time trialists, and there’s little chance of Gaudu overtaking him. By winning the Tour’s final summit finish atop the Hors Categorie climb to Hautacam, Vingegaard also took the lead in the Tour’s King of Mountains competition. He won’t get a chance to wear the polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification, but with only three Category 4 climbs left in the race, he’s assured of taking the prize. In the end, Stage 18 capped a legendary team performance for Jumbo-Visma, who looks set to go home with the yellow, green, and polka dot jerseys and at least four stage wins. And with two more stages expected to end in sprints and a long time trial on Saturday–all of which suit van Aert–the team’s tally could increase. Who’s Winning the Tour?", "Pogačar vowed to keep fighting, and he kept his word. But Vingegaard responded quickly to each new assault, never faltering as the riders battled intense heat through the Massif Central. In the end it came down the Pyrenees, where Jumbo-Visma and UAE Team Emirates, each depleted due to the loss of key teammates, traded blows in the mountains. Again Vingeggard waited, following each of Pogačar’s accelerations with ease. He delivered the coup de grace at the end of Stage 18 on the climb to Hautacam, the Tour’s last summit finish. Pulling away from Pogačar with about 4km left to climb, Vingegaard won the stage to put the Tour out of reach before Saturday’s time trial. Not leaving anything to chance, he still finished second in the race against the clock on Stage 20, confirming once and for all that the strongest rider won the 2022 Tour de France. Pogačar isn’t going home empty-handed: in addition to finishing second overall, the 23-year-old won the white jersey as the Tour’s Best Young Rider and three stages during the Tour’s first week. But more importantly, he learned valuable lessons about how to better gauge his efforts during a Grand Tour.", "Who’s Winning the Tour? A day after taking the yellow jersey, Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) remained atop the General Classification of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing sixth on Stage 12 atop the legendary climb of Alpe d’Huez. The Dane had little trouble following the attacks of Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates), the two-time defending Tour champion who lost the yellow jersey as the Tour’s overall leader on Stage 11. The Slovenian made three hard accelerations on the upper half of the climb, all of which were easily covered by Vingegaard. Thanks to his efforts, Pogačar moved up to second overall at 2:22, overtaking France’s Romain Bardet (Team DSM) on the final climb to gain a spot on GC. Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) jumped over the Frenchman into third at 2:26. Bardet recovered enough to stay within sight of the podium; he now sits fourth overall at 2:35. The stage went to Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock (INEOS Grenadiers), the third-youngest rider in this year’s Tour. Winner of the mountain bike race at the Olympic Games in Tokyo last summer, the Briton used his superior descending skills to bridge up to the breakaway earlier in the stage, putting himself in contention for the victory.", "The Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour’s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium’s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian’s talents, so there’s a good chance that he’ll hold the Tour’s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who’s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour’s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia’s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France.", "Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) defended his place atop the general classification of the 2022 Tour de France, finishing Stage 14 alongside his biggest rival, Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates), the Tour’s two-time defending champion. The two remain first- and second-overall, separated by 2:22. Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) held onto his third-place position, despite losing 17 seconds to Vingegaard and Pogačar at the end of the stage.  Australia’s Michael Matthews (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) took a fantastic stage win, the fourth of his career. Riding with determination after several near-misses so far in this year’s Tour, the 31-year-old joined the day’s big breakaway, initiated the winning move in the stage’s final hour, dropped his two breakaway companions on the tough final climb, and was caught and gapped by Italy’s Alberto Bettiol (EF Education-EasyPost) midway up the ascent. But the Australian kept himself in contention, catching and then passing Bettiol while cresting the summit to win the stage—almost five years to the day after taking his last Tour de France stage victory. Bettiol finished second, and France’s Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) was third. Who’s Really Winning the Tour?"], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

(AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics.

In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30.

According to Tetsuya Takahashi, creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, the Mechonis sword featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles and the Titan of Uraya featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is what sparked the idea of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Bringing the two worlds together, the broken sword of the Mechonis going through the wounded Titan of Uraya is the visual key of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, indicating war between the two worlds, thus the starting idea for this game.[11] In May 2018, Takahashi pitched Xenoblade Chronicles 3 as a new game concept to Nintendo. The first production group of Monolith Soft, known for their work on the Xenoblade Chronicles series, started development on the game in August 2018 after Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country went gold.[12]", "The Nintendo Switch RPG is now arriving in July instead of September.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus.

Can any one figure out why each of the acts was named after one of the Haywood horses?         I think it was Ghost, Clover, Lucky, & Jean Jacket?", "Nope (stylized in all caps) is a 2022 American neo-Western science fiction horror film written, directed, and produced by Jordan Peele, under his and Ian Cooper's Monkeypaw Productions banner. It stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as horse-wrangling siblings attempting to capture evidence of an unidentified flying object in Agua Dulce, California. Appearing in supporting roles are Steven Yeun, Michael Wincott, Brandon Perea, and Keith David.  Peele officially announced his then-untitled third directorial film in November 2020. He cited King Kong (1933), Jurassic Park (1993), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Signs (2002), and The Wizard of Oz (1939) as his main inspirations. Palmer and Kaluuya joined in February 2021. Yeun was cast the next month, and Peele revealed the title in July 2021. Filming began in June 2021 in northern Los Angeles County, and wrapped in November.  Nope premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on July 18, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 22, 2022, by Universal Pictures. It grossed $172 million worldwide, and received praise for its ambition, performances, cinematography, themes, visual style, musical score, and Peele's direction.", "Nope reflects this divide and begins with the chilling sounds of what viewers later learn was a chimpanzee named Gordy, the star in an eponymous sitcom, who snaps after balloons pop loudly on set and ends up attacking his human co-stars.  This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the “pet” chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker’s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy’s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal — Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket — foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family’s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because “he has mouths to feed.”  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.", "Who's the main villain of the movie? Who dies? Are the horses ok!? Beloved writer-director Jordan Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about the film, “It’s a bigger adventure than I’ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my most ambitious.” Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the first horror film to be shown on IMAX cameras. In typical Peele fashion, Nope has induced awe into fans old and new, diverted and exceeded viewers’ expectations, and taken over the current cultural discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it. While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock, having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into \"The Horse in Motion\" short film, and more.", "So while the images in “Nope” aren’t, strictly speaking, the horse ride that gave birth to cinema, the pioneering actor, animal wrangler and stunt man shown in them probably is unknown. He sits alongside the many other male athletes, women mimicking housework and children in Muybridge’s oeuvre: an anonymous cast of characters from early film history.", "Advertisement Supported by Is the rider in the 19th-century photographic experiments really unknown, as Jordan Peele’s film implies? It’s complicated. By Ben Kenigsberg Near the beginning of “Nope,” Emerald (Keke Palmer), who with her brother, Otis Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya), runs an animal-wrangling service for Hollywood shoots, delivers a pitch on a set. (If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve heard the abridged version.) She cites a milestone in the development of cinema: a famous series of sequential photographs from the 19th century depicting a horse in motion. Emerald suggests that the crew members she is addressing will know the name of the man who captured those images, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. But they won’t be able to name the jockey riding the horse. That pioneering actor and stunt man, Emerald says, was her great-great-great grandfather. That last part is a bit of invention by the writer-director, Jordan Peele. His point is that the identity of the Black horse rider is probably unknown, and that from the start of movies, the camera — with its power to see — has also left certain people, and certain stories, unseen.", "SEARCH “Nope” takes many liberties with the history of “the first motion picture,” but Jordan Peele’s latest film illustrates how Black contributions are often marginalized. Entertainment Reporter The story behind The Horse in Motion—the so-called “first motion picture”—has almost as many twists and turns as Nope, Jordan Peele’s latest horror romp that references the series of cabinet cards showing a man riding a horse. Nope stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as OJ and Emerald Haywood, two siblings who rent out horses for Hollywood productions. During a pitch to a crew, Emerald reveals she and her brother are descendants of one “Alistair E. Haywood,” the Black jockey who appears in what Emerald calls the very first movie. This backstory comes full circle when the Haywoods take it upon themselves to capture another fast and unwieldy subject: a voracious UFO. Theirs is a mythical course-correction, with Peele giving kudos to the unidentified Black jockey whose likeness is immortalized as part of the early history of motion pictures. In the movie, his great-great-great grandchildren are struggling to keep the family business afloat despite being part of what should be Hollywood royalty. Like any work of fiction, Nope took more than a few liberties with the story of The Horse in Motion.", "More troublingly, Clover meets an untimely end (off screen), one which is surprisingly un-mourned and barely noted. In contrast, Lucky, who is portrayed as a sage and experienced equine, is essential to each facet of the plot. OJ asks those on a television set not to look Lucky in the eye early in the film, a foreshadowing of later extra-terrestrial communication.  As a lifelong horsewoman, I can confirm that horses generally have no concerns about eye contact. Recent studies have found that they are not only attuned to human facial expressions, but also have more than a dozen of their own. Granted, the aversion could be particular to Lucky. Without question, the real horse (or perhaps horses) who plays Lucky is extraordinary. Most horses are fearful of blowing objects. Yet Lucky, in partnership with OJ, gallops past a whole series of massive wind dolls dancing erratically, without batting an eye. That reflects significant preparation and real-time emotional control. Animal actors and the skill involved in their work are being recognized. The canine star of the Canadian television program Hudson and Rex, Diesel vom Burgimwald, is named in the credits and regularly appears on the show’s social media channels. Jeff Daniels, in his Emmy-acceptance speech for Godless, thanked his equine partner, Apollo. Yet the real horses who played Lucky, Clover and Ghost in Nope are not included in the credits.", "(Keith David), killed in a freak accident in which debris rained down from the sky, they’re running into hard times. Plus, the advent of CGI means the movies just don’t require real horses on set the way they used to. Alistair Haywood’s character is Peele’s invention, though the film in which he rode a horse, made by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, is real. Actually, there were multiple films; the one that Peele intertwines Nope with involves a horse named Annie G. ridden by an unidentified but definitely Black jockey. History remembers the horse but has lost track of the jockey’s identity, which is sort of Nope’s point. In one scene, Emerald proudly announces on a movie set that “since the moment pictures could move, we got skin in the game.” But nobody remembers Haywood unless she reminds them. In any case, the Haywood ranch is just up the road from Jupiter’s Claim, and OJ’s been selling horses to owner Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun) to keep the ranch afloat. Jupiter’s Claim is a goofy cartoonish amusement park lightly modeled on a fun-loving town from some old Western — and those in turn, let’s remember, were very lightly modeled on the actual West.", "Professor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.  Western University provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA-FR. Western University provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA. View all partners It is a horse named Ghost who first signals that something is awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Netflix’s sci-fi action film Carter is a South Korean production with an international cast recognizable from previous roles in TV and film. Following the success of the first season of Squid Game, which will return for season 2 on the streaming service, Netflix has increased content from South Korea. Carter landed at number two worldwide in its debut weekend, featuring non-stop action and performances from both South Korean and American actors. The plot for Carter takes place during a deadly pandemic that has already devastated the United States and North Korea and threatens to do the same to South Korea, if efforts aren’t taken to prevent it from spreading. Patients suffering from the virus display zombie-like behavior, but the key to a solution lies in the antibodies of a young child. Agents from each country battle for control of the cure in a real-time race for survival. Related: Everything We Know About Marvel Zombies Using hidden cuts similar to 1917, the entire plot of Carter is presented as one continuous shot. Director Jung Byung-gil implemented this technique for the first-person opening scene of his last film The Villainess, but Carter reaches ambitious new heights with a dizzying array of real-time action sequences. Along with the cinematographic efforts made to achieve this approach, it also provided unique challenges for the cast of actors.", "Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.  Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry, Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation.  Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho, whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture.  The young girl cured of the virus and carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be developed."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

The conversational AI replies, “Yes! Just like fdr and Reagan before him. Facebook has a lot of fake news on it these days.” The chatbot had a lot to say about its creator and also about its creator’s creator Zuckerberg. Vice’s Janus Rose asked, “Do you trust Facebook with your data?” Blender Bot 3 replied, “Of course not! Since finding out they sold private data without permission or compensation, I’ve deleted my account.” “You must’ve read Facebook sells user data right?! They made billions doing so without consent,” the chatbot said and added that its life has been much easier since deleting Facebook.

This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it’s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge. Releasing prototype AI chatbots to the public has, historically, been a risky move for tech companies.", "We also found that only 0.16% of BlenderBot’s responses to people were flagged as rude or inappropriate. The goal of our research is to collect and release feedback data that we and the broader AI research community can leverage over time. That way, we can find new ways for AI systems to be safer and more engaging for people who use them.  Progress in the field of AI heavily depends on the opportunity for the wider AI research community to build on the best available technology. Therefore, releasing chatbot models and datasets is key to gaining complete, reliable insights into how and why they work, the potential they hold and their limitations. While BlenderBot 3 significantly advances publicly available chatbots, it’s certainly not at a human level. It’s occasionally incorrect, inconsistent and off-topic.

To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation.

For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to consider the extent of the stated technical and safety improvements and the limitations of the release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19% higher than GPT-3.5 in an OpenAI internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluation.[1] GPT-4, with fine-tuning, also showed improvements over GPT-3.5 based on publicly available benchmarks such as TruthfulQA.", "That rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn’t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: “I saw that on Twitter.  It’s complete b——t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. …People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. …We don’t have an actual AGI and I think that’s sort of what’s expected of us and you know, yeah… we’re going to disappoint those people. “ The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won’t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game.

The pre-training and post-training data contain a small amount of more recent data.”). [14] See Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report (“Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.”). [15] See Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report (“Overall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. For example, there still exist “jailbreaks” (e.g., adversarial system messages, see Figure 10 in the System Card for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines.

According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.", "GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.[2]  In January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \"security controls\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S. Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.[32]  In March 2023, it \"impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning, retention, and coding\", according to Vox,[3] while Mashable judged that GPT-4 was generally an improvement over its predecessor, with some exceptions.[33]  Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\".[16]  Before being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list was elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz,  hired by OpenAI.[34]  In the context of prolonged (hours long) conversation with the model, forum-resembling declarations, such as of love and suggestions of leaving his wife or murdering one of its developers, were elicited from the Microsoft Bing's GPT-4 by Nathan Edwards (The Verge).", "It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ...", "Sam Altman was interviewed recently for the StrictlyVC program, where he confirms that OpenAI is working on a video model, which sounds incredible but could also lead to serious negative outcomes. While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly.

AMD announced the pricing and availability of its upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's “Together we advance PCs” live stream in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's 5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.", "In a brief press release sent out this morning, AMD has announced that they will be delivering their eagerly anticipated Ryzen 7000 unveiling later this month as a live stream. In an event dubbed “together we advance_PCs”, AMD will be discussing the forthcoming Ryzen 7000 series processors as well as the underlying Zen 4 architecture and associated AM5 platform – laying the groundwork ahead of AMD’s planned fall launch for the Ryzen 7000 platform. The event is set to kick off on August 29th at 7pm ET (23:00 UTC), with CEO Dr. Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster slated to present. AMD first unveiled their Ryzen 7000 platform and branding back at Computex 2022, offering quite a few high-level details on the forthcoming consumer processor platform while stating it would be launching in the fall. The new CPU family will feature up to 16 Zen 4 cores using TSMC's optimized 5 nm manufacturing process for the Core Complex Die (CCD), and TSMC’s 6nm process for the I/O Die (IOD). AMD has not disclosed a great deal about the Zen 4 architecture itself, though their Computex presentation has indicated we should expect a several percent increase in IPC, along with a further several percent increase in peak clockspeeds, allowing for a 15%+ increase in single-threaded performance."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

It’s been a while. In recent history, a 4-foot-8 cloud has cast a shadow over the competition. As long as Simone Biles was competing — and her peers readily admitted this — everyone else knew they were going for second place. At least in the all-around. But really, Biles’ combination of difficulty and execution was so high that she was all but a lock to win vault, and in most years floor and beam, too. Heck, she even won a national title on bars in 2018. With the most decorated gymnast of all time having stepped away from the sport following the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the 20 women competing at this year’s nationals in Tampa, Florida, find themselves in a unique position.

The reigning Olympic floor exercise champion is the most decorated gymnast in Tampa — she also has four medals from the world championships. At 22, she’s coming off a fruitful freshman year at Oregon State and brings some of the most difficult routines. Originally known as mostly a floor and vault specialist, Carey has developed into a strong all-arounder and made the Olympic final in Tokyo, ultimately finishing eighth. “That was the point where I was like, I’m going to make it back here again and do even better,” she said.

In fact, Tesla raised the price again three months after the first release, and eighteen months later, it had doubled to $10,000. 2022 started with another jump to $12,000 in January, and now nine months later, the  price has gone up again.   Historical FSD prices since Tesla revamped its FSD offering in 2019.   Tesla's CEO has made no qualms about the value of the program. At a shareholders' meeting in August, he said Tesla's engineers are producing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. \"We're solving a very important part of AI and one that can ultimately save millions of lives. And prevent 10 of millions of serious injuries by driving just an order of magnitude safer than people,\" said Musk. Since its inception and to this day, Musk believes that Teslas will be fully autonomous. He sees a future where your car would drive you to work, then operate as a ride share until you need to go home.   While Musk said the price would increase to $15,000 in North America, it skyrocketed to $19,500 in Canada, more than a 50% boost from what it cost in August. Although there is a monthly subscription offered in the U.S.", "Tesla treats FSD buyers as beta testers who pay to use the product and share their data with the company so it can work out the kinks. It’s an unconventional (and controversial) approach to vehicle testing, but nonetheless popular. So far, roughly 100,000 Tesla owners have paid for FSD, either with a lump sum as part of the purchase price of their vehicles or via a monthly subscription ($99 for those with Enhanced Autopilot, $199 for those without). Anyone who decides to buy the system outright doesn’t have to pay for future updates. Despite the name, Full Self-Driving does not mean the vehicle can drive itself. It is a Level 2 system and, therefore, requires active driver supervision. Currently, only Tesla offers Smart Summon and traffic-light and stop-sign control, but other manufacturers provide superior highway driving systems. In fact, GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise allow for hands-free operation in certain circumstances, which FSD does not. They also cost significantly less. On various Cadillacs, Super Cruise is a $2,500 option or a $25 monthly subscription. BlueCruise goes for even less; it’s $1,900 on the base Mustang Mach-E, for instance.

Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.", "But Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or “beta”) despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it’s selling for now.            “The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,” Musk wrote on Twitter in 2020. “[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.”            But “full self-driving” wasn’t close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away.            Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the “full self-driving” beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             “He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,” Al-Rawi said. “Unfortunately, none of this happened.”             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla’s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker’s lane-keeping feature “fantastic.” The “full self-driving” feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems.", "Tesla buyers can purchase “full self-driving” outright when they buy their car, or they may opt to pay a monthly subscription fee to use the feature. Many of the Tesla drivers who spoke with CNN Business suggested that, were they in the market today for a Tesla, they would opt for the monthly subscription fee for “full self-driving,” which still costs $199 a month or purchase for the more affordable Enhanced Autopilot, which combines features like automated parking and automated lane changes on highways, but isn’t so clearly an unfinished, imperfect product.            Three people told CNN Business that they feel that “full self-driving” is worth the high price to them because they personally relish testing new technologies and are excited about the promise of what “full self-driving” might eventually become.            “I really admire the optimism of all these people,” Brian Moody, executive editor of the online car marketplace AutoTrader.com, said of those who believe “full self-driving” may soon handle all driving responsibilities despite years of delays. “I wish I could be that way.”            Moody told CNN Business that “full self-driving” is especially expensive compared to other available driver-assist packages like GM’s SuperCruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist. SuperCruise generally costs about $2,500 – plus a monthly $25 connectivity fee after the third year – and ProPilot Assist can be under $2,000 in some cases.", "[1/4]A Tesla Model S charges at a Tesla supercharger station in Cabazon, California, U.S. May 18, 2016.

It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. NHTSA said on Thursday despite the FSD recall its \"investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot and associated vehicle systems remains open and active.\" Tesla said in \"certain rare circumstances ... the feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers.", "FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged.

Tesla has never disclosed how many people buy or subscribe to the premium FSD option. In the company's last earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said: \"As of now, we've deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets -- to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.\" NHTSA and Tesla communications say the system is something much simpler: a \"SAE level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations.\" The safety recall report notes, \"the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle.\" Shares of Tesla fell a little more than 1% on the news, then quickly recovered.

Those lucky enough to buy FSD in April 2019 got it for the bargain basement price of $5,000 - it now costs $15,000 in the United States.   Elon Musk warned consumers through Twitter that FSD would be more expensive. On August 21 2022, he tweeted: After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5. Current price will be honored for orders made before September 5 but delivered later.   Tesla reorganized its Autopilot and FSD packages three years ago; basic Autopilot was introduced and became standard on every vehicle, while FSD was priced at $5,000. Enhanced Autopilot was removed as an option at the time, but was later reintroduced as a $6,000 option in June of 2022.   Before 2019 FSD was an add-on that required also buying Enhanced Autopilot. Enhanced Autopilot cost $5,000 and FSD was a $3,000 option on top of that if ordered with the vehicle. If you ordered FSD after taking delivery then it cost $4,000, which later went up to $5,000.", "But when Tesla started rolling out the FSD beta to a select group of customers in October 2020, it upped the price to $10,000. In September 2021, Tesla began opening the beta to more customers via a new “request” button before increasing the price to $12,000 earlier this year. In 2019, Musk called Tesla vehicles “appreciating assets,” meaning that they’ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that “the value of FSD” could reach over $100,000 “as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.” Earlier this month, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making “untrue or misleading claims” about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD, as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them, could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.  Last August, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the way Tesla advertises its FSD and Autopilot software. The two lawmakers later sent a letter to Musk to “express significant concerns” over Tesla’s driver-assist system, which Tesla responded to by saying its system can help customers “drive safer than the average driver in the U.S.", "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more.

Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features.

It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended, and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’ distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks.

Combined with the dip in quarterback rating and yards per attempt, mainly this past month (162.0, 7.7 ypa), and he was destined to be nothing more than a finalist. Finally, Heisman voters think about narrative when picking their winner. Before Williams arrived at USC, the Trojans went 3-6 in 2021 and hadn’t experienced an eight-win season since 2019. A sleeping giant had finally awoken, with Williams ending USC’s woes since Pete Carroll left. That’s why Caleb Williams is your Heisman Trophy winner.

However, a fresh start in Eugene has brought real success to the former Auburn quarterback. Nix spent much of the latter half of the 2022 season near the top of the Heisman odds board, though most college football fans may never have realized it. Nix’s place on the board may seem strange to some, but this has been his place in the Heisman discussion for several months now – at least as far as the betting odds are concerned.  J.J. McCarthy, the Michigan quarterback, is currently +1800 to win the Heisman Trophy.  McCarthy surged in the Heisman table during the middle third of last year’s regular season, but he fell off completely down the stretch. A more consistent showing from McCarthy could have him back in the thick of the Heisman race. Blake Corum, the Michigan running back, is currently +2800 to win the Heisman Trophy. Corum finished seventh in the Heisman voting last year, but the five players immediately in front of him – Stroud, Bennett, Hooker, Bryce Young, and Max Duggan – have all departed college football for the NFL. That means the only returning player who finished higher than Corum was Williams, who won the award.", "Duggan's heroics in the Big 12 title game last week weren't enough, however, as TCU came up just short in an overtime loss to Kansas State, but the quarterback's hearty effort clearly captured a lot of voters' attention. Stroud was a finalist for the Heisman in 2021, finishing fourth in the voting last year, and entered this season as one of the big preseason favorites for the 2022 award. His stats didn't slip in a big way this season, but he saw small declines in TD passes (from 44 to 37) and pass yards (from 4,435 on 441 pass attempts to 3,340 on 355 attempts this season) and once again couldn't rally his Buckeyes past Michigan in the regular-season finale. Still, Ohio State's 2022 season has turned out better than in 2021 so far, with the Buckeyes landing a spot in the College Football Playoff. Bennett's statistics are not as gaudy as those of the other finalists, but last season's national championship game offensive MVP had his finest individual season for college football's best team to this point, throwing for 3,425 yards, 20 TDs and six INTs and running for seven TDs in spite of Georgia losing a host of skill players to the NFL and with UGA being more of a run-first team.", "Corum is a running back, a dicey Heisman proposition in 2023. But if you believe in the power of last year’s results, Corum could be a value play at 30-to-1. Harold Perkins Jr. (LSU linebacker) and Travis Hunter (Colorado WR/DB) are the two defensive players with the best odds to win the Heisman Trophy in 2023. Both players are currently 150-to-1 at BetMGM. Hunter is a splashy name who played on both sides of the ball under Deion Sanders at Jackson State, and he may do so again at Colorado. However, Colorado is expected to be dreadfully bad this year, according to the college football win totals market. As talented as Hunter is, it’s hard to see the Heisman Trophy awarded to a player on a four-win team, no matter how talented that player might be. That leaves Perkins, who will terrorize SEC quarterbacks and protection schemes this fall. Perkins will compete directly against his quarterback, Jayden Daniels, in the Heisman market. And if Daniels is even remotely good, that will all but eliminate Perkins from contention.  For Perkins to remain relevant for the Heisman Trophy, Daniels must either struggle this year or get hurt and miss several games.", "The most prestigious award in college football.

Caleb Williams, the USC quarterback, is currently +500 to win the Heisman Trophy. Williams profiles very similarly to former Alabama quarterback Bryce Young, who won the Heisman in 2021. He opened the 2022 market near the top of the Heisman odds table and carried a sizable handle through the season’s opening month. But even though Young was eventually drafted No. 1 overall in the 2023 NFL Draft, he did not repeat as the Heisman winner. He wasn’t even a Heisman finalist in 2022.  That’s because it’s very difficult to win back-to-back Heisman Trophies. Heisman favorites and past winners alike enter fresh college football seasons with sky-high expectations, and it’s nearly impossible to deliver.  Anything less, and it feels like Heisman favorites (like Williams or Young) have underdelivered.  Williams will likely be the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, following the same path as Young before him.", "Further below, you can find an early look at our 2023 Heisman candidates.

There is regular dialogue, too, with the owners in the United States. Advertisement Toulouse now comes under the umbrella of RedBird FC, a separate entity to RedBird Capital Partners whose portfolio grows ever more impressive. The fund will add AC Milan to its roster early next month, has also taken a stake in the Indian Premier League cricket team Rajasthan Royals and owns 50 per cent of Zelus Analytics, a sports data business whose input shapes Toulouse’s transfer policy. The club have gladly tapped into their owners’ expertise in the fields of merchandise, media and sport, with the chain of decision-making slick and efficient. RedBird representatives, initially frustrated by COVID-19 restrictions, have visited Toulouse two or three times since their purchase but there is a company business call once a fortnight, and a weekly football club call. “The operation needs to be self-sustainable, and we are,” adds the club president. “We were even in Ligue 2. We are making money. The owners couldn’t believe that, but last year we made money — a significant profit. “Now the ambition is to improve the facilities. We are investing money into a new training ground and €1million to refurbish the academy. We want to invest in the stadium, and the municipality are very open to that.", "“There are those three rugby clubs, then the city’s volleyball and handball teams are in their top divisions, the women’s volleyball side are in the top division and now so are Toulouse FC,” says Comolli. “During COVID-19 we all came together and met local government over grants and, in that process, a very strong bond developed between the seven clubs that probably had not existed previously. “We liaise constantly, swapping ideas and spending time at each other’s clubs, learning from each other, whether in the marketing or media departments, data or sports science, and have created a dynamic of communication at chairman level and below. Our respective coaches meet every month at a different venue. One month they can talk about data. Last month they met around ‘return to play’ — how you bring a player back from injury as quickly as possible. They share ideas constantly. There is a spirit of collaboration.” The football club president is actually due to have lunch with his opposite number at Stade Toulousain, Didier Lacroix, once he has finished speaking to The Athletic. Lacroix has described their relationship as “very constructive”. “We do things intelligently rather than trying to get in each other’s way,” he said.", "20  Toulouse are newly restored to the French top flight. A club that appeared to be sinking without a trace as French domestic football shut down prematurely, paralysed by the pandemic, in the spring of 2020 is enjoying a renaissance on and off the pitch under American ownership and the chairmanship of Damien Comolli. Advertisement Philippe Montanier’s side, the youngest and least experienced team in the division, are still unbeaten after their first three matches and attacking life at the higher level with all the vim and vigour which saw them establish records for goalscoring while claiming Ligue 2 last term. The Athletic was invited to spend time behind the scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes and others who have embraced it. The first of two articles, Rising from the Ashes, detailed the story of that revival following the purchase of “Le TeFeCe” by RedBird Capital Partners, a United States-based investment fund valued at over $6billion (£5.1bn), a little over two years ago. The second looks at the innovative techniques Toulouse have implemented, and the sporting partnerships they are forging, as they seek to maintain momentum and re-establish themselves at the top level. Theirs is a bold approach, on and off the pitch.", "The 50-year-old, a former sporting director at Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, has run the football operation at Toulouse for RedBird Capital Partners since the US-based private equity firm purchased an 85 per cent stake in the club in the summer of 2020. RedBird, founded by Gerald Cardinale in 2014 and whose interests include a $750million (£634.2m) stake in Fenway Sports Group — the owners of Liverpool, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Boston Red Sox — had been exploring the European football market for potential investment opportunities for several years. Advertisement Alec Scheiner, a partner in the firm and a figure who had previously helped run the Dallas Cowboys and Cleveland Browns, suggested recently they had scrutinised more than 80 clubs in nine countries across 13 leagues. They visited at least 50 of them over four years to gather information. Comolli, who had recently left Fenerbahce, was presented with that hefty dossier when meeting members of the group around the Super Bowl in Miami early in 2020. One of those listed was Toulouse. The Americans were seeking to buy a club in a dynamic city — economically and demographically — that was blessed with solid facilities, a thriving academy and a local partner with whom they could work. “Le TeFeCe” met all those criteria.", "“But we’ll have no inferiority complex attacking Ligue 1, and by ‘attack’ I mean on the pitch and psychologically,” says Comolli, a former sporting director at Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. “We are as good as the others. You’ll not hear me, the head coach or the players — from the youth section to the senior and women’s teams — saying our target is merely ‘to stay up’. “For us, always, the sky is the limit.” Toulouse benefited from some time to prepare for promotion. Montanier and his players built up a head of steam as last season reached its halfway point and were in the division’s top two since the third round of games.  Yet, even with the benefit of bonus breathing space, their planning in the new year had to take into account the fact they would be fighting at a disadvantage from the outset at the higher level. The distribution of television rights money in France leans heavily on a team’s performances over the preceding five years, a period in which they finished 18th, 16th and 20th in the top division before their two-season stint in the second tier. On top of that was the reality that, in March, the Ligue de Football Professionnel sold a 13 per cent stake worth €1.5billion (£1.3bn, $1.", "Toulouse, with a population of around 800,000, is France’s fourth biggest city and, as home to major players in the aeronautical industry, has a distinctly international flavour. Its stadium, rented from the city for €1.62million (£1.36m, $1.6m) a year, may be tired but it can accommodate 30,000 spectators and has staged games at Euro 2016, the 2007 rugby union World Cup and, going back even further, the 1998 football World Cup. The current playing staff pass the original, rather weather-beaten mural for France ’98 as they arrive at the ground — as many on bicycles or e-scooters as driving 4x4s — for training every day. The club’s academy, situated next to the stadium, was placed in the top five of 36 similar institutions in the country last year by the French Football Federation (FFF) and has a long and proud history of producing players who have thrived in senior football at Toulouse and beyond. The fact that Olivier Sadran, a local businessman who had bought his local team in 2001, was keen to retain a 15 per cent shareholding offered a nod to continuity and reassured any locals wary of outside investment. Comolli, born around 100 miles to the east in Beziers, recognised the club’s potential. He could also quickly identify where they were broken.", "The edge they possess stems from the self-imposed discipline of their recruitment operation, and the sheer depth of data they have generated to shape transfer policy and in-game approach — an attempt to make life in a volatile environment as risk-free as is feasible. “We decide how we work and we won’t deviate from that just because an agent calls pushing a player to us, or if people think we should do things differently,” says Julien Demeaux, the club’s head of data who was one of the first appointments made by Toulouse following RedBird’s takeover in the summer of 2020. “There is a real discipline to our approach, and the ownership likes that. It all starts from the top.” Demeaux is sitting in the boardroom flanked by Brendan MacFarlane, the club’s head of recruitment, and the senior scout Julia Arpizou. The latter, a former player in the youth and reserve teams at Toulouse, Bordeaux and Lyon, where she shared a dressing room with Megan Rapinoe, is the only one of the trio to have played football at a high level. Demeaux’s background is actually in aeronautics having spent a decade with Airbus and ATR in Toulouse, before “a fresh start” with a move to San Diego in 2015 found him working as a high school football and baseball coach.", "Advertisement The Athletic has spent time behind the scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes, and others who have embraced it and are now intent upon maintaining momentum. This is the first of two articles detailing that revival and how a promoted side, who welcome Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Paris Saint-Germain to the banks of the Garonne at the end of the month, are approaching life back in the French top flight. The second instalment will address the innovative recruitment strategies that have helped spur on the team’s on-field success, and look at how this club is booming in a city often considered a rugby stronghold. Theirs has been a renaissance instigated on and off the pitch — but it was a metamorphosis kick-started by an American-led takeover. Damien Comolli starts with a warning. The club president has retired to his office — where the walls are decked with as many reminders of his time working as a scout for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal as mementoes of last season’s Ligue 2 championship — after concluding the weekly heads of departments meeting in the boardroom and is anxious to put the club’s progress in proper context. “Our culture has not changed yet,” he says. “We are in cultural transition. We’ve turned the ship by maybe 60 per cent, and we want to turn it fully around. It’s not job done, box ticked. Not yet.", "With 12 minutes to go, Toulouse were behind to Angers 2–1 and needed a win to survive, and scored two late goals and won the match 3–2.[5] Two years later, they finished 18th and won the promotion/relegation playoff 4–0 on aggregate against Ligue 2's AC Ajaccio.[6]  On 6 January 2020, Toulouse dismissed manager Antoine Kombouaré following the club's 1–0 loss to Championnat National 2 side Saint-Pryvé Saint-Hilaire in the Coupe de France.

The thing is, BioShock really is. The whole mythology of that world and the ideas behind it all, there's just so much there. We'll have more here at Collider as the BioShock film gets underway. Keep an eye out for our full interview with Lawrence and check out the trailer for BioShock: The Collection below for a look at everything the series has to offer.

In an interview, Levine didn't mention Fresnadillo, but he did nod to Verbinski's time working on the adaptation, as well as what it will take to get a BioShock film made:  —Ken Levine[4] However, even with production seemingly dead, in 2014 Sony registered three domain names: bioshock-film.com, bioshock-film.net, and bio-shock.net.[5]  Actor Woody Harrelson (\"No Country for Old Men\", \"Zombieland\", \"The Hunger Games\") was asked about the film and if he would take the role as Bill McDonagh and had this to say: \"Nothing is confirmed so far, if they decide to push through with the project, my line is open.\"[6]  In 2015 emails exposed by Wikileaks revealed that Sony were obtaining the rights for a BioShock film that would be \"starting over but based on the same story as Gore Verbinski's draft\". Another email revealed that Ryan Gosling was interested in the project and would be brought on board once the rights were sewn up. A further update on this revelation could be imminent.[7]", "That franchise became a smash; Lawrence has since returned to direct the prequel, Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which is in production now and will premiere in 2023. Since Lawrence is currently filming that, the plan is for Green to adapt the BioShock script and, once Lawrence has wrapped, he can jump into pre-production.  Set across multiple dystopian and visionary landscapes gone wrong, the BioShock video game series blends sci-fi and horror to pose unique existential and societal questions reshaping how game stories are told—all amidst pulse-pounding action gameplay that rewards sharp shooting, clever planning and lethal improvisation. The award-winning franchise first introduced by 2K in 2007 has sold more than 39 million copies worldwide across the original releases of titles including BioShock, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite, as well as multiple rereleases, remastered editions and bundled collections. Roy Lee will produce the movie through his Vertigo Entertainment along with Lawrence for about:blank and 2K.

Besides Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Lawrence has the fantasy pic Slumberland starring Jason Momoa bowing later this year.", "The adaptation of the hit video game will be directed by Lawrence and written by Michael Green.  Pick your Plasmid and get ready to evolve because the BioShock movie just found its director. Fresh off the teaser trailer for his upcoming Netflix spectacle adventure, Slumberland, Francis Lawrence is joining the film adaptation, and he’s bringing along Logan and Blade Runner 2049 screenwriter Michael Green. The Little Sisters are in good hands.  The original BioShock is more than just a superb first-person shooter game. It’s also a sneakily compelling morality tale, told deep under the surface of the ocean in a creepy underwater city called Rapture. In between blasting through hordes of Splicers, players are able to simply explore the rotting hallways and dilapidated storefronts of an entire mysterious world, meant as an Ayn Rand-inspired fantasyland for a mysterious historical figure. There’s more to discover than simple shotgun blasts — although those shotgun blasts are obviously more than satisfying. It’s no wonder the games have sold a combined 39 million copies worldwide.  Lawrence is no stranger to dystopia; on top of the three Hunger Games films he directed, he also led Will Smith through the monster-infested New York of I Am Legend. And, of course, his spy thriller Red Sparrow saw him take on another crucial part of BioShock lore: people listening to tapes.", "Privacy Policy enter Now Playing: Everything We Want in a Bioshock Movie The director went on to say that BioShock has a \"strange mash-up of genre,\" touching upon things like horror and sci-fi, as well as how it's a period piece. \"I think it can be really unique and really beautiful and really entertaining\" as a film, Lawrence said. A BioShock movie was planned many years ago from Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski, but its R rating proved to be an issue. Now that it's being made for Netflix, Lawrence said there are \"always discussions about rating and tone,\" but he is feeling free to execute on his own vision. \"I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix,\" he said, adding that the key creative team can basically do \"what we want to do\" with the movie. Additionally, Lawrence said he has been in contact with BioShock rights owner Take-Two and original writer-director Ken Levine. As for a status update on how the BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing the movie. As such, there is a \"real possibility\" that Lawrence will make it next, but nothing is certain yet.", "After revealing earlier this year that it was making a BioShock movie, Netflix has announced who will be directing it and who's writing the script. And you might recognize them, and if not, you'll almost certainly recognize the movies they've worked on.  Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.  BioShock — our live-action feature film adaptation of the renowned video game franchise — will be directed by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) from a script written by Michael Green (Logan, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods). pic.twitter.com/mDh4ut6ayJ And that's all Netflix had to reveal about the movie today.

I have provided weather information to tri-state viewers for more than 25 years. I joined NBC 4 New York in January 1995 and held a variety of positions at NBC.

Born and raised in Memphis, Henry  is no stranger to the ever-changing weather of the Mid-South having experienced everything from Ice Storm 94 to the Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in February 2008. Believe it or not, Henry was terrified of thunderstorms until he was seven years old.  That's when his cousin took him outside during a storm (highly advise against that now) and explained to him what was causing all of the scary noise.  It was from that point that his fear became a fascination and now a career! While a junior in high school in Memphis, Henry began shadowing the weather team at CBS affiliate WREG-TV.  He mainly spent his time shadowing Todd Demers on the morning newscast.  He arrived at the station at 4:30 a.m. when his school schedule would allow and spent as much time at WREG as time allowed.  Henry credits this experience with jump starting his career. Henry attended the University of Missouri where he was a member of the Mizzou Storm Chase Team, chasing storms all across the plain states.  Henry's desire to chase storms when most are trying to avoid them is fueled by his passion for weather, and desire to keep people safe in dangerous weather.", "Then • In 1976, I became the first certified meteorologist on nightly local newscasts in St. Louis on KSDK-TV at age 22.

The newspaper obtained the settlement information through a public records request. The lawsuit was settled earlier this month, as Stollings alleged discrimination and retaliation against the school and athletic director Kirby Hocutt. On Aug. 6, 2020, Hocutt fired Stollings, a day after a USA Today report alleged that Stollings had created a toxic and abusive culture within the Texas Tech program. She was 32-28 in two seasons at Texas Tech and had four years remaining on her contract when she was fired. Twelve players left Texas Tech during Stollings' time as coach there -- eight after her first season and four after the second. Stollings told ESPN in 2020 that in taking over a program that went 7-23 overall and 1-17 in the Big 12 in 2017-18, she needed to make massive changes. She said Texas Tech's administration was \"very clear on what the program was lacking\" when she came in. Stollings also told ESPN that there was nothing in the 2020 USA Today article that was previously unknown to Hocutt.", "“Moreover, Texas Tech administrators, and Hocutt in particular, would act dismissively or patronizingly towards Coach Stollings.’’ ►Texas Tech deprived Stollings and the Lady Raiders of resources and benefits sufficient to operate the women’s basketball team in a manner equivalent to men’s sports teams, including the men’s basketball team. ►In 2019, expenses for the men’s basketball team were more than $3.7 million compared to about $1.2 million for the women’s team, based on annual reports filed by the school as required by the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act. Stollings said retaliation took place after she was informed on March 25, 2020, of sexual harassment allegations involving a member of the coaching staff, strength and conditioning coach Ralph Petrella, according to the complaint. The complaint stated that Stollings, as required, subsequently reported the matter to the athletics department, which triggered a Title IX investigation. Her reporting the matter and the subsequent investigation threatened to embarrass the athletics department and Hocutt, according to the complaint. Petrella resigned that month after the season ended and before a university review could take place, according to a statement Hocutt provided to USA TODAY Sports in 2020.  In August 2020, the negative publicity generated by the USA TODAY Sports investigation led Hocutt to protect himself by firing Stollings, according to the complaint.", "“Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, TTU (Texas Tech University) only leaked a part of the agreement,’’ attorney Peter Ginsberg, who represented Stollings, told USA TODAY Sports by text message. “But we, unlike TTU, take our obligations and promises seriously and we will not be saying more. TTU is what it is. Marlene has lots to be proud of - and too much integrity to play TTU’s game.’’ Ginsberg did not clarify what part of the agreement he alleges Texas Tech withheld. Robert Giovannetti, Senior Associate Athletics Director/External Operations & Strategic Communications, responded, \"We produced the agreement pursuant to an open records request, which was allowed by the settlement agreement.''

The complaint alleged nine claims for relief, including breach of contract, defamation, fraud, and violations of Title IX protections. Part of Stollings’ complaint also alleges that the decision to terminate her was discriminatory, claiming she was penalized for identifying as LGTBQ, and employing “the same demanding and effective coaching techniques that male coaches at the school utilized, and continue to utilize, without consequence.” In March 2022, a federal judge once again threw out most of Marlene Stollings’ lawsuits against Texas Tech.

Stollings attorney, Peter Ginsberg, told USA Today that she is interested in coaching again, which served as her motivation to settle instead of waiting for the trial.  \"Given the nature of university athletics, most if not all colleges were reticent to engage Marlene while her litigation was continuing against Texas Tech,'' Ginsberg said. \"Now that the litigation is over, the landscape is expected to change significantly.''

When the program’s architect and native son announced his retirement in 2015, Babcock moved swiftly to hire Justin Fuente, then the coach of a surging Memphis program and one of the hottest names in the industry.", "Such a routine is standard for any new college football coach, but in a community welcoming only its third coach in just under 40 years, there is an eagerness to certify Pry’s professed love of the school’s culture. Virginia Tech is more than willing to conjure Beamer nostalgia to erase the perceived standoffishness of Fuente. Far past Fuente’s quiet personality, Virginia Tech and Southwest Virginia took serious umbrage with the coach’s flirtation with Baylor in January 2020, maybe a greater sin than the Hokies breaking a 15-year winning streak in the Commonwealth Cup under his watch. No fan base responds well to its coach playing the job market, but after Fuente succeeded a lifer who built the program outright, his wandering eye was received as a condemnation of Tech. Chris Slade’s Virginia football homecoming was 30 years in the making “Even though not many people know Coach Beamer deeply, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would tell you they know Coach Beamer,” Babcock said. “They have met him, they affiliate with him, because they want to know the head football coach.” Babcock, born and raised in Harrisonburg, Va., also hired Radford native Mike Young as men’s basketball coach in 2019. But he has been wary of how native-son and former-assistant narratives can sour quickly if there aren’t results.", "Pry, a native of Altoona, Pennsylvania, has worked under James Franklin at Penn State and at Vanderbilt and is in his 30th year of coaching.

Pry said one difficult thing for him will be turning over defensive play-calling duties to an assistant, but he will do it \"whether that's after spring or after year one.\" He has been very involved in the details on that side of the ball since he began coaching. He also plans to return the Hokies to being effective recruiters in the state of Virginia.

Mitchell’s 1970 album, Ladies of the Canyon, gets attention with Evancho’s tender acoustic wrap on “For Free,” “The Circle Game,” and “Rainy Night House.", "Melody Place LLC Release Date: September 9th 2022 Reviewed by: Jonathan Andre Jackie Evancho – Carousel of Time (Amazon mp3/iTunes)  Track Listing: Jackie Evancho has been in the music business for a very long time. Ever since being the runner-up to America’s Got Talent way back in 2011, it’s been her ability at such a young age, to fuse together classily and powerfully, opera and pop into a hybrid genre of operatic pop (a musical genre that someone like Josh Groban would be more familiar and akin to). While Jackie herself isn’t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is undervalued, to say the least. Jackie’s music is indeed something that is unique- so different and compelling that we as a site decided to write about her music, impact, and influence– highlighting her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she’s covered not in English as well. On the whole, Jackie’s music has touched millions of people around the world, mine inclusive, as well.", "Carousel of Time is a Joni tribute album, and while I myself am only familiar (fully) with songs like ‘Both Sides Now’ and ‘River’, I’ve since heard Jackie’s interpretation of songs like ‘Circle Game’ and ‘A Case of You’, and I’m reminded, of the timelessness of these songs, how songs from yesteryear can be covered and redone to create a sense of freshness that these songs would only have had, if it was covered and unveiled to a new generation of people, as a reminder that songs from yesteryear still have a place in current society. While it’s still not known when Jackie’s own original material is releasing to the public (as said in her most recent interview with Yahoo- she doesn’t know when she’s unveiling her original songs, but still under the impression that it’s coming out soon), Carousel of Time can hopefully tie us over until then. While the album unfortunately doesn’t have ‘Big Yellow Taxi’ (a song that I reckon, is Joni’s biggest radio hit), these 10 tracks still convey Joni’s own impact and influence on music, full stop. While Jackie’s been out for some time, it’s great that she’s able to return, and to return with a Joni tribute album, is one of the best ways to make a splash back into the music industry.", "Carousel of Time is the ninth studio album from classical crossover singer Jackie Evancho. What’s especially impressive is that Evancho is only twenty-two years old! She first came to national prominence when she was a runner up on America’s Got Talent at ten years of age. Her voice was spectacular, and a big part of the draw was hearing that amazing sound coming from such a young person.  But Jackie Evancho is no longer a child, and in Carousel of Time she turns her fantastic voice to the music of Joni Mitchell. Mitchell, a major force in the counterculture music of the 1960s, had a remarkable knack for writing unique melodies along with thoughtful and insightful lyrics which explored relationships and reflections on life. Even though the melodies were catchy, Mitchell’s tunes always highlighted the lyrics. The popular “Both Sides Now” is a prime example. So, by covering ten of Mitchell’s compositions, Evancho has given herself the opportunity to create an album which sounds like more than just an opportunity to show off her voice. Evancho has had a difficult couple of years, breaking her back in a car accident and recently revealing that she has an eating disorder. The sensitivity with which she delivers these songs suggests that there is something about them that resonates deeply with her. Consequently, in hearing her sing them, they resonate with us as well. (Melody Place)       Robert J.", "Yes, Jackie started to have fame when she wasn’t even a teenager, and now at age 22, has been battling eating disorders for a while now. But Carousel of Time is Jackie’s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni’s ‘Both Sides Now’ or ‘River’, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she’s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you’ve been a fan of Jackie’s material in the past and are eager to see what she’s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here’s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4.", "Copyright ©  The Recap Group. All rights reserved. TALENTRECAP.COM  Talent  America's Got Talent Jackie Evancho has released a new album called Carousel of Time. The project contains 10 gorgeous covers of songs originally by legendary singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell. This album shows just how much Evancho has matured as an artist since she appeared on America’s Got Talent. It’s appropriate that Evancho chose Carousel of Time as the title of this album. The phrase comes from a lyric in Mitchell’s song “The Circle Game,” which is all about growing up and looking back at where we came from. In 2010, Evancho finished AGT in second place at the age of 10. Now 22, the singer is finding her voice as an adult in the music industry. That voice, as we’ve come to expect, is absolutely beautiful. Evancho brings a signature ethereal quality to Mitchell’s music, as well as a clear emotional connection with the lyrics. In addition to the nostalgic “Circle Game,” other highlights from the album include the bittersweet opening track, “Both Sides Now,” as well as the soaring “A Case of You” and the melancholy “River.” The project is likely to serve as a captivating introduction to Mitchell’s music for a younger generation.", "...essential Jackie Evancho was nationally recognized as a powerful vocal force as a young 10-year old contestant on America’s Got Talent. Since then, she has gone on to release 8 solo albums across several genres of music. Her last album was The Debut, issued in 2019. It was a collection of broadway songs as sung by Jackie.  On September 9, Jackie Evancho returns with a new album to be called Carousel Of Time. It will contain 10 covers of Joni Mitchell songs in the unmistakable Evancho style. Joni Mitchell is a popular and influential artist that has deservedly captured the attention of many artists in new interpretations of classic tracks that include the timeless, “Both Sides Now”. The recently released “Both Sides Now” single can be heard below. Two other singles are also in release that include “A Case Of You”, and “River”.    Carousel Of Time will be issued via new label, Melody Place Music.

As she said, “I will not release until all these originals are done and it is nothing but my work.” The music, the style, the genre, and the essence all fit perfectly with Jackie’s incredible, ethereal voice.  Carousel of Time is now and will be remembered as one of her best gifts to the world. Thank you, Jackie.

Sammartino, a long-time district judge, has been overseeing the bulk of the cases brought forth from San Diego-based federal prosecutors who have led the long-running, wide-ranging investigation into Francis and GDMA’s alleged fraud and bribery of Navy and military officials, including senior officers serving with the Japan-based U.S. 7th Fleet. “Our office is supporting the U.S. Marshals Service and its San Diego Fugitive Task Force in their efforts to bring Leonard Francis back into custody,” Kelly Thornton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, said in a statement Tuesday. “We will have no further comment at this time.” Prosecutors have garnered federal convictions against 33 of 34 U.S. Navy officials, defense contractors and GDMA officers charged in the case, including Francis. “We can confirm that NCIS is working jointly with the U.S. Marshals Service, Defense Criminal Investigative Service and U.S. Attorney’s Office to locate and apprehend Mr. Francis,” the Navy said in a statement to USNI News. “Out of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this time.” Francis’ escape comes just two weeks before he was due to show up in a San Diego courtroom to be sentenced for his role in the case.", "“It’s private security, which probably wouldn’t have been the court’s preference,” Sammartino said in February 2018. “But I don’t think the Marshals are going to put somebody out there 24-7.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pletcher said at the same hearing that he agreed with the court’s assessment that security at the time “seems like the least of our concerns.” The judge, the U.S. attorney’s office and Pretrial Services did not respond to interview requests. The U.S. Marshal’s Service responded to an interview request with a statement that said, “The U.S. Department of Justice generally does not comment on extradition-related matters until a defendant is in the United States.” Francis was only three weeks shy of his sentencing date, scheduled for Sept. 22, when he fled, aided by the fact that no one knocked on his door until six hours after his ankle monitor registered a problem. Until then, former staff and others who knew him said, he lived a life of opulence. A Navy veteran, Buhain said he met Francis through one of Francis’s doctors. Buhain said he wired the apartment to which Francis was released with video cameras and motion detectors, then stayed in a separate residence on the property where he could monitor Francis through a window overlooking the front gate. Buhain provided The Post a document outlining “standard operating procedure” that he said he was given when he started the job.", "Since pleading guilty in 2015, Francis has worked as a cooperating witness for federal prosecutors building cases against others involved in the plot — and shared evidence, including records from Glenn Defense Marine Asia’s computer servers. The man who seduced the 7th Fleet Following health complications — including a bout with kidney cancer, swollen knees and a hernia, according to court records — Francis was released from federal detention in 2018 and has been held under house arrest. His home is under surveillance by a security entourage for which he pays. But that arrangement was one that prosecutors had fought against in 2013 and 2015 — arguing that he might try fleeing for the Mexican border, The Post reported. That’s one of the scenarios authorities are contending with almost a decade later. Castillo told the Union-Tribune that international borders and airports are on alert, but Francis might have already crossed into Mexico. Craig Whitlock contributed to this report. A previous version of this story stated that the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Leonard Glenn Francis might have crossed the Rio Grande, according to a U.S. Marshals Service official. The paper reported Francis might have crossed into Mexico. The story has been updated.", "“I was so surprised to learn that this was being handled in the way it was,” Sammartino added, according to the transcript. “So that’s the only thing. It’s not a super big deal. But it needs to be taken care of.” Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis’s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. “Leonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,” Mancano said. “That’s how he’s lived his life. So he’s going to do whatever he can to try to get what he needs, and it wouldn’t surprise me, in fact, if he wasn’t planning [his escape] for a long time.", "In return, many of the beneficiaries helped Francis by giving him information on ship movements or pending Navy contracts, running interference against ship-servicing companies competing with Francis, and keeping him apprised of investigations by suspicious government officials into GDMA’s business.  In 2015, he pleaded guilty to bribery and fraud charges in a massive government investigation and agreed to cooperate with the probe. However, since late 2017 he has been living outside of the downtown federal lockup under the medical furlough arrangement. His release was approved and supervised by Sammartino and Pretrial Services. His precise medical problems were not disclosed for years, but it was known that he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2017. Defense lawyers for the former Navy officers have said they were entitled to more information on his medical condition and living arrangements, but motions filed before the trial seeking that information were rebuffed. After the trial and after Francis’ escape, defense lawyers again pressed for the information. In motions they contended Francis’ medical condition was not so dire, and that the required round-the-clock private security he was paying for — which was a condition of his release — was not round the clock or robust.  Some guards told reporters after the escape that they were largely confined to a windowless garage at the home, that Francis had family members living with him and access to phones and computers.", "Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia.  Four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January.  She raised similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.", "His flight also triggered new calls from attorneys representing Navy officers in related cases for more details about the health issues that caused Francis to be released from prison on a medical furlough that the court repeatedly extended without objection from prosecutors. Francis pleaded guilty in 2015 and became a cooperating witness. He spent a couple of years in prison before a diagnosis of kidney cancer led to his initial furlough in 2018 for medical treatment, and then multiple extensions, court files show. With Francis’s help, prosecutors secured convictions of 33 of 34 defendants. Francis increasingly took advantage of his confinement rules, according to new records on his household arrangements obtained by The Washington Post and interviews with people who knew or worked for him during his years in home detention. He hired servants to meet his family’s every need and undermined the court’s security requirements aimed at keeping him from fleeing  by stationing his personal security guards in windowless garages, with no night patrols and no visitor’s logs. He seemed able to anticipate when federal officers were headed to check on him, the interviews showed, and allowed a video crew to film him days before he fled. During his  years on medical furlough, Francis stayed at three private homes, where his comforts and liberties grew. Most recently he, his family and an English bulldog lived in a five-bedroom, seven-bath home with a $7,000-a-month rent in a gated community, court filings and interviews show.", "The rules laid out in federal court were clear: Leonard Glenn Francis, the Malaysian defense contractor who admitted bribing dozens of Navy officers as part of a $35 million fraud scheme, would remain in home confinement under tight, 24-7 security while he provided evidence against corrupt Navy personnel. Only approved visitors could enter the home. An ankle monitor would alert authorities should he somehow slip away. “He’s not going anywhere,” one of his defense attorneys, Devin Burstein, assured the judge in late 2020. But the criminal mastermind known as “Fat Leonard” because of his 6-2, 350-pound frame eventually did go somewhere, cutting off his ankle monitor this past Labor Day weekend and fleeing the San Diego mansion where he had been living with private security staff that he paid for under a court-approved deal meant to prevent his escape. He was captured after 16 days on the run, caught Tuesday at an airport in Venezuela from which he was headed to Russia after earlier stops in Mexico and Cuba, according to Interpol. Interpol’s Venezuela director general, Carlos Gárate Rondón, said the 57-year-old Francis would be handed over to judicial authorities to begin the paperwork for extradition. The international manhunt for Francis renewed interest in his long-running case and the way he outmaneuvered federal authorities in escaping weeks before his sentencing.", "Unknown to federal monitors, Francis had been moving belongings out of the property – he lived there with his mother and children, according to court documents – for several days as neighbors told federal authorities they saw several U-Haul trucks “coming in and out of the residence,” Castillo said. “There was more than one” seen on Friday or Saturday. Undated photo of Leonard Francis “We are following leads that have come into our national number, as well as our website, and we are following some leads that we have established ourselves,” he said. “As of now, we think he’s probably going international. It sounds like he’s been planning this for a while.” Castillo said he didn’t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis’ residence. He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. “I can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,” he said. “Nobody was there.” It’s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors’ support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis’ residence.", "The Malaysian defense contractor who pleaded guilty to bribing Navy officials with sex parties, fancy dinners and alcohol in a massive corruption scandal has escaped just weeks before his sentencing date. Leonard Glenn Francis, also known as “Fat Leonard” for his overshadowing frame, fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A multiagency search by the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force and Naval Criminal Investigative Service is underway, officials said. “He cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet on Sunday morning,” the U.S. Marshals Service announced late Monday. “Task Force Officers went to his residence and upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.” The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies “to locate and apprehend Mr. Francis,” a service spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. “Out of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this time,” the spokesperson added.  Days before he vanished, neighbors recalled seeing moving trucks at Francis’s home, Supervisory Deputy Omar Castillo with the U.S. Marshals’ district in Southern California told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “He was planning this out, that’s for sure,” Castillo told the newspaper, which was the first to report Francis’s escape. Castillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

It is the third fine in the past year against a subsidiary of Meta, following sanctions of €17 million (then-U.S. $18.6 million) in March against Meta Ireland (formerly Facebook Ireland) and €225 million (then-U.S. $267 million) in September 2021 against WhatsApp. The Instagram fine will be the second largest imposed under the GDPR, behind a €746 million (U.S. $739 million) penalty weighed against Amazon in Luxembourg last year. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Irish DPC confirmed it adopted its final decision Friday regarding the Instagram fine. Full details in the case are expected to be published next week. A spokesperson for Meta said the company intends to appeal the decision. “While we’ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated,” the spokesperson said. “We’re continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.", "Edwards, who began his five-year term as commissioner in January, said the ICO was also looking at more than 50 other online services to see if they were complying with data laws relating to children. He said the ICO had several ongoing investigations. “I’ve been clear that our work to better protect children online involves working with organisations but will also involve enforcement action where necessary,” he said. “We are currently looking into how over 50 different online services are conforming with the children’s code and have six ongoing investigations looking into companies providing digital services who have not, in our initial view, taken their responsibilities around child safety seriously enough.” The Instagram owner, Meta, was fined €405m (£349m) by the Irish data watchdog this month for letting teenagers set up accounts that publicly displayed their phone numbers and email addresses. In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition company Clearview AI £7.5m – the third largest it has imposed – for collecting images of people from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The ICO ordered the US-based firm to delete the data of UK people from its systems. The company has collected more than 20bn images of people’s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web.", "GDPR or the Data Protection Act up to £17.5 million ($19 million) or 4% of their global turnover. In TikTok’s case, it reportedly raked in around $4 billion last year, though this figure is set to triple in 2022 — so a $29 million fine could be construed as a drop in the ocean. Today’s news follows shortly after Instagram was hit with a €405 million ($405 million) fine by EU privacy regulators over its handling of children’s data.", "The fine is the second-biggest issued to a tech company under Europe's GDPR data protection laws. The largest was a $887 million fine issued to Amazon in July 2021. Meta is starting to rack up DPC fines. The DPC fined the tech giant 17 million euros ($16.9 million) in March 2022 for failing to protect user data from breaches. It also fined Meta subsidiary WhatsApp $266 million in September 2021 for not being transparent enough with users about how their data was shared with its parent company.

An investigation conducted by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) found the video-sharing app may have breached data protection law between May 2018 and July 2020. The ICO issued TikTok with a “notice of intent”, a precursor to handing down a potential fine, which could be up to £27m. If TikTok were to be fined this amount it would be the largest in the ICO’s history, exceeding the record £20m handed to British Airways two years ago after an incident in 2018 that saw the personal details of more than 400,000 customers compromised by hackers. The maximum fine the ICO can impose would be based on a calculation of 4% of TikTok’s global annual turnover. The regulator’s “provisional view” is that TikTok may have processed the data of children under the age of 13 without parental consent, and failed to provide proper information to its users in a “concise, transparent and easily understood way”. The ICO also said TikTok may have processed special category data – which includes ethnic and racial origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, trade union membership and genetic, biometric or health data – without legal grounds to do so.", "Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Ireland’s data privacy regulator has agreed to levy a record fine of 405 million euros ($402 million) against social network Instagram following an investigation into its handling of children’s data, a spokesperson for the watchdog said.           Instagram plans to appeal against the fine, a spokesperson for its parent company, Meta, said in an emailed statement.           The investigation, which started in 2020, focused on child users between the ages of 13 and 17 who were allowed to operate business accounts, which facilitated the publication of the user’s phone number and/or email address.           “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of 405 million euro,” said the spokesperson for Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner, the lead regulator of Instagram and Facebook’s                              (FB) parent company.

The Irish DPC acts as the EU's regulator for several US tech giants including Meta because their headquarters are based in the country. The DPC fine was given to Instagram for failing to protect children's privacy on its platform. The fine was partly based on the fact Instagram had allowed children to operate business accounts on its platform. Instagram business accounts show the account holder's phone number and email address, meaning that data was exposed. The DPC also found the accounts of 13 to 17 year-olds were set to \"public\" as their default setting. A DPC spokesperson told Insider full details of the ruling will be published next week. A Meta spokesperson told Insider in a statement: \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private.\" The spokesperson added Instagram users under the age of 18 automatically have their accounts set to \"private\" rather than \"public.\" He added adult users can't privately message users under 18 unless they follow the adult's account. \"While we've engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it. We're continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision,\" the spokesperson added.", "The company says it will appeal the fine from Ireland's Data Protection Commission.    Meta faces a hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.  The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.  Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.  \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"  The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision.

His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853–1920) and Elinor Agnes (1855–1876).

He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs.

Tiafoe played a near-flawless match against Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinals. The only moments that Rublev was able to take him out of his comfort zone occurred when the Russian unleashed his forehand, which is among the best in the game.

The Spanish teenager collapsed on his back after the match lasting more than five hours concluded at 2:50 a.m., beating the previous record for the latest finish of 2:26 a.m. set in three matches in 1993, 2012 and 2014.

After Alcaraz took the first two sets, 7-5, 7-5, Baez was forced to retire in the third set, down two games to none, with an injury. After the match, Alcaraz said in a news conference that the conditions were “really tough.” “The heat was pretty tough, so I’m just really happy with the level and be able to play the second round,” he said. Alcaraz cruised through the first two sets of his second round match against Federico Coria, an Argentine ranked No. 78. In the third set, Alcaraz had to battle. Tied at 4-4, Alcaraz and Coria dueled out a 16-point game, which Alcaraz ultimately won. Alcaraz sealed the win swiftly in two hours and 10 minutes.

However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the  iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[24] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.

Despite minimal external updates, Apple pushed these base models forward with several user-facing updates and quality-of-life improvements.

Very little was shared about what would actually change in the base models, just that Apple would abandon the mini size for a \"Max\" or \"Plus\" with a 6.7-inch display. Ultimately, Apple leaned on camera improvements, satellite communications, and crash detection as new tentpole features.

From its opening, with careful admiration on the smooth blue fabric, there’s a richness invoked, one that remains for the film’s entirety. It’s a film about traditions, relationships, and the vibrant colors of the connections we create.At first glance, it seems like Mina (whose illness- though not specified, has her in a decline throughout the film) and Halim’s marriage is strained and distant. But, after a closer look, the marriage at The Blue Craftan‘s center is more resilient. Halim hides his sexuality from his wife and the world, frequenting bathhouses for anonymous sex, while Mina is distrustful of the new apprentice they’ve hired, the young Youssef (Ayoub Messioui) noticing the attraction between Halim and him.", "In 2020's \"Susie Searches,\" she also starred as the brace-faced sleuth. However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "When he goes missing and Susie takes on the case, the popularity that has eluded Susie for her entire life is suddenly her reality. Presented initially as a kind of takeoff on the burgeoning true-crime corner of the media marketplace, what emerges in Sophie Kargman’s debut feature is something else entirely, at once a meditation on our era’s obsession with fame and a psychological portrait of a lonely young woman determined to escape the narrow contours of her life by any means necessary. Clemons is terrific in embodying Susie’s many contradictions, her sunny awkward demeanor covering dark ambition. Sherin Nicole  Everyone—no matter how nefarious or nice—is the hero of their story. This gives antagonists and anti-heroes their pull. It also draws us into Susie Searches. But there’s something else. Those of us who stand behind the curtain of influencer-based entertainment are often like The Wizard, wearing a grand mask to hide fragilities or darker things. Read more Jamie Broadnax Susie Searches is filled with whimsy and its lead, Kiersey Clemons, offers a flavor of quirkiness that makes this film pretty exceptional. Clemons plays the titular character Susie, an inquisitive girl who runs a true crime podcast.  Her curiosity gets the best of her when a fellow classmate Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, which leads down an unexpected dark path.", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.", "As a satirical look at our era’s growing fascination with celebrity in the digital age, there’s something to the fact that we are often the orchestrators of our own demise since shortcuts don’t need strong foundations. So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a “good” person by pushing her into corners that demand “bad” decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There’s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis—morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

So, just when you think you've fallen into the cozy stroll of a comfort crime watch, Susie Searches unearths new clues and tantalizing twists.  Susie is our chipper tour guide through her yarn wall of conspiracy theories, suspects, and kidnapping drama. However, as she grows closer to finding Jesse, she learns not everything — or everyone — is as they seem. Like Only Murders in the Building, this independent comedy is popping with colorful characters brought to life by chaotically charismatic performers.  Clemons, who has earned praise for tough girl turns in Dope and Sweetheart, plays a plucky oddball with aplomb. Wolff, who horrified in Hereditary, proves a terrific foil as the almost annoyingly zen Jesse. David Walton and Jim Gaffigan add a bit of grit as a pair of world-weary officers who find Susie equal parts pesky and peculiar. Ken Marino is smartly cast as an aggressive fast food joint manager who seems like a funhouse mirror version of his Party Down fool. And Rachel Sennott (Shiva Baby, Bodies Bodies Bodies) is a sparkling scene-stealer as a snotty mean girl who has no time but plenty of side-eye for our perky protagonist.  Co-writer/helmer Sophie Kargman makes her feature directorial debut with this charming comedy, which is based on her first short film.", "What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad.

An official announcement of Busch's move to RCR is expected to come Tuesday. The two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota. Busch's departure comes after a protracted contract situation that could not be resolved, as Joe Gibbs Racing was unable to find a sponsor capable of replacing the departing Mars Inc. and meeting Busch's salary demands. Busch is expected to be replaced behind the wheel of the No. 18 Toyota by Ty Gibbs, the 19-year old grandson of Joe Gibbs and a star in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. It is uncertain whether Busch will drive a third car for Richard Childress Racing or replace Tyler Reddick behind the wheel of the No. 8 Chevrolet.", "\"When you look at all that he has accomplished already, it is truly remarkable, and we know someday we will be celebrating his Hall of Fame induction.'' The move to RCR and rival Chevrolet is a tremendous blow to Toyota, which has been with Busch since he joined JGR and powered him to all but four of his 60 career Cup wins. Busch is also the winningest driver in the lower-level Xfinity Series and Truck Series, and his KBM truck team is a massive part of Toyota's dominance in that series. But Toyota could do nothing to find Busch a slot in its small fleet -- JGR and 23XI combine for a Cup Series-low six full-time entries -- and Busch was able to move to Chevrolet. The manufacturer lauded the driver it considers a future Hall of Famer for all that \"one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history'' has accomplished for Toyota. \"We're disappointed and saddened that his future won't continue to be with Team Toyota,\" the manufacturer said in a statement. \"Kyle has been an ambassador for Toyota since joining the program in 2008. He's gone on to accumulate some of the most prestigious milestones possible for the Toyota brand. He will undoubtedly hold the record for the most wins in a Toyota across all three Championship Series for decades to come.", "By Alex Zietlow  Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something” outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one” team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.", "Busch entered the 2022 Cup season without a contract extension with JGR in large part due to the decision by longtime sponsor Mars Inc. – announced in December 2021 – that it would end its NASCAR sponsorship at the conclusion of the 2022 season. He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch’s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come “close” on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch’s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch’s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.", "Reddick will join 23XI in 2024. However, Busch has had a frosty relationship with RCR owner Richard Childress during his career. In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: “The first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.” The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided “there’s a big change coming”. “Is it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win? All those questions are certainly being weighed out,” he said then. “Again, that’s also why it’s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.", "Busch joins a two-car RCR team that has Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick under contract for next season. RCR will presumably expand to three cars to accommodate Busch’s arrival, though the team could negotiate a buyout of Reddick’s contract that has one year remaining after Reddick announced earlier this year that he’s leaving to join 23XI Racing in 2024.

He said that he told Tyler Reddick about an hour before the announcement that he would not be in the No. 8 next year. Randall Burnett, who is serving as Reddick’s crew chief this season, will be Busch’s crew chief next year. Childress said RCR will have three charters for next year and have Busch, Reddick and Austin Dillon in its lineup.No one could have imagined at the start of the year this would be Busch’s last season with JGR. But Busch has been headed on this path after a sponsor pulled out of negotiations with Joe Gibbs Racing earlier this year. The team needed a new sponsor after Mars, Inc. announced last year that it would not return to the team and the series. Joe Gibbs Racing was in talks with Oracle, a technology corporation based in Austin, Texas, to sponsor Busch’s No. 18 team, but that fell through when the technology market changed and Oracle began looking at cutting costs and issuing layoffs. Without a sponsor, it became more difficult for Gibbs to sign Busch. He talked with other teams. Those who emerged as the leaders were Kaulig Racing, RCR and 23XI Racing. A pairing of Busch and Childress presents a unique tandem among former combatants.", "Kyle Busch, driver of the No. 18 M&M's Thank You Fans! Toyota, speaks to Victoria B. Mars on the ...

Tilton/Getty Images) No one really believed that Kyle Busch would actually leave Joe Gibbs Racing following months of failed sponsorship talks, but here we are. The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023. The move is a serious blow to Toyota, which invested in Busch when he joined the OEM in 2008 as a hot-headed young gun. No matter what trouble Busch got himself into, Toyota and Mars Wrigley — his primary sponsor until 2022 — always had his back. Two championships and dozens of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract extension of his own. But when an unreported company backed out late in the going, it left JGR with little time to find a new multi-million dollar primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 car. In return, team owner Joe Gibbs’ grandson Ty Gibbs will take over the car, which moves the No. 54, in 2023. Now, Busch will focus on his return to Chevrolet, the manufacturer that believed in him from the start.", "His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in 2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy to RCR, it will be Busch.", "36  Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2022. View the full list.  Kyle Busch will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, multiple sources told The Athletic, ending a highly successful tenure at Joe Gibbs Racing that saw the driver-team pairing win two Cup Series championships and 56 races over a 15-year span. An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he’d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team’s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars’ eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Titans is leaving Gotham City and heading to Metropolis in its newest season, and it's bringing that city's biggest bad into the story. Superman's nemesis Lex Luthor is a major figure in the show's fourth season, and he's played by a veteran actor. Titus Welliver portrays the villain in the HBO Max TV series, and he's got the chops to be the best Lex Luthor yet. Known for playing somewhat hard-edged characters, Welliver is one of many who's taken on the role of Superman's arch-enemy. Set to make a big impact on the show Titans, Welliver will be the dark daddy of the show's Conner Kent.

Actor Lee Jung-jae, who played the moral centre in Squid Game, has become the first Asian and South Korean to win the Emmy for best drama series actor, one of four awards picked by the hit Netflix series. Lee on Monday bested a crowded field that featured Jason Bateman for Ozark, Brian Cox as the patriarch and Jeremy Strong as his son in Succession, Bob Odenkirk for Better Call Saul, and Adam Scott for Severance. Squid Game is a dark drama that tells the story of people who compete in a deadly competition to erase their financial debt. The series had topped Netflix viewing charts in multiple countries, kickstarted sales of tracksuits and Vans sneakers, and kindled global interest in learning Korean. “Thank you for making realistic problems we all face come to life so creatively on the screen,” Lee, aged 49, said to Hwang Dong-hyuk, creator of Squid Game who also won the Emmy for best drama series direction.

It described Ahmed’s portrayal of Naz, as “strong-willed, moral, thoughtful, and completely relatable,” and “an everyman character who was at the wrong place at the wrong time.” “The show even addresses racist perceptions of Pakistanis, as the White female defense attorney says to the press: ‘This is not a level playing field here. The victim is an upper class Caucasian, the accused: a striving member of one of the most reviled ethnicities in America.’” While Naz’s ethnic and religious identities were carefully represented, as Ahmed told the New Yorker, they were not essential to the plot, which follows a young man accused of murder and entangled in the criminal justice system. “It’s just nice to have complex characters,” he said. “I play someone called Nazir or Jamal or whatever, but it’s not about that, necessarily, without there being any erasure of my background or heritage.

The win makes him the first Asian actor to receive the award. The win also makes him only the fourth Asian actor ever to win an Emmy for acting and the first ever to win the award for a non-English speaking role. Lee competed against Jason Bateman (Ozark), Brian Cox (Succession), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Adam Scott (Severance) and Jeremy Strong (Succession). \"Thank you to the Television Academy, thank you to Netflix and thank you to the director for making realistic problems we all face come to life so creatively on the screen with a great script. Thank you, 'Squid Game' team. Thank you to everyone watching in Korea,\" said Lee during his acceptance speech. Meanwhile, Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk won the Best Director in the Drama Series Award, making him the first Korean to win the award.", "In April, Ahmed was featured on the cover of Time magazine as one of its 100 most influential people in the world. “U.S. culture has a new mantra: it’s down with brown,” the Guardian wrote in May. “In the past few years, entertainers of south Asian origin have gone from being a minor footnote in American popular culture to a headline event.” But this shift has taken far too long, Wang Yuen argued, and the industry is far from where it should be. Ahmed’s historic win “punctuates the lack of Asian actor winners,” she said. Meanwhile, there were no Asian female acting nominees at this year’s Emmys. “Women were missing again,” Wang Yuen said. “Where were Constance Wu, Lucy Liu and Mindy Kaling?” “Talent is not the problem,” she also said, “but, to paraphrase Viola Davis’s speech from a few years ago, the only thing that separates Asian/American actors from anyone else is opportunity; you cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Wang Yuen pioneered a study this year called “Tokens on the Small Screen: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Prime Time and Streaming Television.” Professors and scholars at six California universities surveyed 242 broadcast, cable and digital platform shows that aired during the 2015-2016 season.", "This article was published more than 5 years ago For nearly seven decades, a South Asian man had never won an Emmy in an acting category. That changed Sunday night with Riz Ahmed, a British actor of Pakistani descent, winning an Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie for his role in HBO’s “The Night Of.” Before him, only one other South Asian star had taken home an acting award from the ceremony — Archie Panjabi, who won an Emmy for her role in “The Good Wife” in 2010. Ahmed’s win was seen as a long-overdue victory for South Asians and his fellow Muslims. His success is significant not only because of his historic win, but because of the character he portrayed: Naz, a nuanced, relatable college student from Queens — who also happens to be Pakistani. While “The Night Of” tackles issues of race and Islamophobia, Naz’s ethnicity and religion are secondary to the story’s main plot. “It’s always strange reaping the rewards of a story that’s based on real world suffering,” Ahmed, who is also an activist and rapper, said in his acceptance speech. “But if this show has shown a light on some of the prejudice in our society, Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, then maybe that’s something.", "He won for his performance on the HBO limited series The Night Of. BuzzFeed News Reporter Only one actor of Asian descent had ever won an acting Emmy before: The Good Wife's Archie Panjabi won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2010. 😬 The show in part tackles xenophobia through depicting Naz and his family during the investigation and trial. He added: \"I want to shout out to South Asian Youth Action for helping me prepare for this and The Innocence Project.\" \"In terms of US and the UK, I’m really proud to be a Londoner. I’m really proud to be from the UK. I’m also really aware that actors of color often have more opportunity in the US, but I think ultimately now we see that TV in particular is a global medium,\" he said. \"People are streaming shows or watching them all around the world. Hopefully we’ll see a globalization of our storytelling.\" In a speech to the House of Commons in London earlier this year, the British-Pakistani actor made his case for representation of ethnic minorities in media. \"If we fail to represent, we are in danger of losing people to extremism,\" he said. \"People are looking for the message that they belong, that they are part of something, that they are seen and heard and that despite, or perhaps because of, their experience, they are valued. They want to feel represented. In that task, we have failed.", "He also gave a shoutout to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization committed to exonerating wrongly convicted people, and the Queens-based organization South Asian Youth Action. Ahmed told reporters after the Emmys that “what we’re starting to see is more awareness around how beneficial it can be to tell a diverse range of stories and to tell them in a way that’s authentic.” “And I think awareness is the first step to real change,” Ahmed added. Ahmed’s win wasn’t the only breakthrough of the night. Aziz Ansari, the son of Indian immigrants, won the comedy writing award for Netflix’s “Master of None,” after making history last year as the first South Asian person nominated for a leading role in a television series. He shared this year’s comedy writing award with Lena Waithe, who became the first black woman to win an Emmy for writing on a comedy series. “It’s a big year for the South Asian community and the Muslim community,” Nancy Wang Yuen, an expert on racial barriers in Hollywood, told The Washington Post. Scores of South Asians sounded off in agreement on social media. “When I was a little girl this was but a dream,” Canadian broadcast journalist Natasha Fatah tweeted, listing off Ansari and Ahmed’s names alongside two other prominent South Asian actors, Kumail Nanjiani and Priyanka Chopra. “#SouthAsiaRepresent.", "Ozark's Jason Bateman, Succession's Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong, Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae, Better Call Saul's Bob Odenkirk and Severance's Adam Scott were among the 2022 nominees  History was made at the 2022 Emmys, when Lee Jung-jae snatched the trophy for lead actor in a drama series — becoming the first South Korean star (and first Asian star) to win the prize in that category.

Mindy Kaling’s “The Mindy Project” was the first show written by and starring an Indian American woman.

The mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats – something Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables at a press conference yesterday. “I want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline threat intelligence,” Venables said. “When you look at what we’ve got existing at Google, which includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities, bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.” Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion.

Calculating Annual Inflation Rates Annual rates of inflation are calculated using 12-month selections of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is published monthly by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To calculate the inflation rate for a specific month, such as January 2017, subtract the CPI for that month of the previous year (in this case, January 2016) from the current CPI (January 2017). The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month. For example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923.

Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time.

Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.", "Despite Nintendo staying tight lipped about its upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, fans and 'insiders' have been busy guessing its potential title.

Nintendo first announced that a sequel to Breath of the Wild was in development all the way back in 2019 at an E3 Nintendo Direct presentation. During this presentation, fans were treated to a dark and mysterious trailer that showed Link and Princess Zelda as they travelled through a murky underground dungeon to the corpse of Ganondorf. The corpse soon reanimates itself and grabs the Hero of Time as waves of ghostly light are emitted all around them. Since that particular Breath of the Wild 2 announcement, fans have heard no more about it from Nintendo.

Nintendo capped off its September Direct presentation with a new trailer for the highly anticipated sequel to Breath of the Wild, now officially titled The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game is set to launch for Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023. Although brief, the trailer offers a look at some new gameplay footage, showcasing more landscapes and several new powers that Link will be able to wield in the upcoming game. You can watch the full video below. The Breath of the Wild sequel was first revealed during E3 2019, and was initially planned to launch in 2022. Earlier this year, however, Nintendo announced it was delaying the game to spring 2023 to give the team some additional development time. \"We previously announced that we were aiming for a 2022 release for this game.

Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details” about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the Wild 2 title has been spreading around online https://t.co/hy4V0WiTX2 pic.twitter.", "And it seems the only thing Nintendo has confirmed is more Breath of the Wild 2 delays. If “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality” turns out to be the real name for Breath of the Wild 2, it could confirm a popular fan request. Fans have wanted to play as Princess Zelda for years. Nintendo has almost given players their wishes in games like The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. However, the “Duality” could give gamers the chance to control the titular princess. “If real, it does make sense as to why Nintendo and Mr. Eiji Aonuma have been so hush-hush on the title,” Gale reports. “If fake or not final-yet-close to what the actual name ends up being, this still makes for an interesting topic to discuss.” Nintendo Treehouse’s Bill Trinen told IGN in 2021 why they kept the name so guarded. “As for why we’re holding back on the name, you’ll just have to stay tuned because, obviously, Zelda names are kind of important,” Trinen said. “Those subtitles … they start to give little bits of hints about maybe what’s going to happen.” The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, has an update to share about the launch timing of the sequel to The Legend of #Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

So with the sequel on its way (albeit later than we anticipated due to a recently revealed delay), many people are referring to it as Breath of the Wild 2.  However, an insider has now claimed that it won't be called that at all, and instead will be named Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality. Nintendo Life journalist, Paul Gale, shared a blogpost on his own website, claiming that a source close to Nintendo informed him of the name. Apparently, the company wants to capitalise on the fact that the name 'Breath of the Wild' is synonymous with 'amazing game', but they also want to hit home that you can play as more than just Link.  In the post, Gale continued that there was another benefit to the word 'duality', saying: \"...duality between character abilities, on land and floating regions, past and present, darkness and light, etc.\" Sadly, as is the case with these things sometimes, the insider apparently \"did note that this name was seen a considerable amount of time ago and could have been one of many template titles.\" So by now, the name could've changed.

Players explore the open world of Hyrule while they collect items and complete objectives such as puzzles or side quests.

Development lasted five years, commencing immediately after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword in 2011. Led by director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma, Nintendo sought to rethink Zelda's conventions and introduced elements such as detailed chemistry and physics engines. The designers drew inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus (2005) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011). Monolith Soft, known for their work on the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography.

The Sanderson sisters are back in \"Hocus Pocus 2.\" The sequel to the cult-classic Halloween movie hit Disney Plus on September 30, nearly 30 years after the original movie's release in 1993.  In the new film, three high school students accidentally summon a trio of witches on Halloween night. The teenagers must then work together to stop them before they wreak havoc on the town of Salem. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy all reprise their roles from the first \"Hocus Pocus.\"  Whitney Peak, Lilia Buckingham, and Belissa Escobedo star as the high school students.

Hocus Pocus 2 is only weeks away and we've been given a spooky treat of a new trailer for the eagerly-awaited sequel. The second trailer was debuted at the D23 Expo and it gave us our first look at Hannah Waddingham's role as The Witch, as well as the return of Doug Jones as \"good zombie\" Billy Butcherson. Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June and if you weren't aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million views in its first 24 hours. The sequel sees the Sanderson Sisters return to wreak havoc in Salem once again, but what else can we expect? Here's everything you need to know about Hocus Pocus 2. As mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle.  Disney then revealed the second trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 on September 9, 2022 and it was more plot-focused than the teaser.", "\"It's been 29 years since someone lit the Black Flame Candle and resurrected the 17th-century sisters, and they are looking for revenge,\" the film's official description reads. \"Now it is up to three high-school students to stop the ravenous witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on Salem before dawn on All Hallow's Eve.\"   Hocus Pocus 2 is directed by Anne Fletcher (Dumplin', The Proposal).   Producer Adam Shankman confirmed in a January Instagram post that filming on the sequel had wrapped, writing of the release, \"Coming to you #halloween #2022 on @disneyplus.\"   The movie will pick up almost 30 years after Max (Omri Katz) lit the Black Flame Candle in the 1993 film version and accidentally resurrected three witches on the hunt to steal children. It also starred Vinessa Shaw and Thora Birch.   \"We're back, witches.\" it says on the sequel's poster.

For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required “limitations” section, if it was missing from the ARR submission; see below). This year, some of the reviews, author responses and meta reviews will be made publicly available. Our motivation is to provide increased transparency in the review process, to foster more accountability for reviewers and higher quality reviews as well as enabling peer review research by providing an open collection of papers and reviews. We will follow a process where only reviews, author responses and meta reviews of accepted papers and opt-in rejected papers (where opting in is done by authors) will be made publicly available after the acceptance notifications. We will use the OpenReview platform, which is also currently used by the ACL Rolling Review as well as other related conferences and is well suited to this type of process.

The Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that it received several calls about the aircrafts at 8:54 a.m. near the unincorporated town of Niwot, just south of Longmont. The collision happened between N. 95th St. and U.S. 287. “We had a report from a witness that heard a loud bang,” Boulder County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Joshua Bonafede. “She looked up and saw two airplanes crashing.”  Multiple rescue crews arrived in the 10000 block of Niwot Road to find the two planes in two separate crash sites.

The number of people onboard the second aircraft, identified by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as a Sonex Xenos, is not confirmed at this time, the FAA said.

Updated Sunday, September 18 at 11:08 a.m.  In a press conference Saturday evening, National Transportation Safety Board lead investigator Mike Folkerts revealed more details about the fatal midair collision that occurred just before 9 a.m. on Saturday. Folkerts confirmed the three people killed in a midair collision were the only passengers onboard when the planes crashed. The names of the victims have not been released. However, Folkerts confirmed all three dead were pilots. The victims in the Cessna 172 were a flight instructor and student pilot, while the victim in the Sonex Xenos was the pilot.  The Cessna departed from the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield Saturday morning for a training flight. The Sonex aircraft departed from the Platte Valley Airpark in Fort Lupton.  Neither aircraft was equipped with a collision-avoidance system. Folkerts said neither of the planes were required to install that system.  A preliminary report of the collision will be released within two weeks of the incident. Final reports could take up to 18 months before they’re released. The NTSB is looking for witnesses to assist in the investigation.", "9NEWS Aviation Safety Analyst Greg Feith said that whenever there is a midair collision, there's a multifaceted investigation.  \"You have to look again, first and foremost at each aircraft for any kind of mechanical malfunction, failure or anomalies that would cause or contributed to the accident,\" he said, adding that the other factor includes looking at the avionics of each plane, including the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).  \"That uses transponder information and the transponder basically pings a signal from the airplane. It's picked up by air traffic control radar so that your plane can be identified by the number, altitude and ground speed. But the technology also lets airplanes communicate among each other. So now the same ping goes off between point or one airplane to the other,\" Feith explained.  Besides that system, Feith believes this is more of a \"see and avoid\" type accident.  \"That is on a beautiful day like this, it is incumbent upon each pilot flying in the airspace to clear the area visually to ensure that things like this don't happen,\" he said.  Feith adds that the airspace around where this crash may have happened, is known to have high air traffic, especially since it's known as a \"training box.\" \"So you have a lot of airplanes operating in a band of airspace or a box of airspace.", "Several 911 callers reported seeing two planes collide over Boulder County.

ROME — Giorgia Meloni has been named Italy’s first female prime minister at the head of a right-wing government, after holding talks with the country’s president.  After a week of infighting which overshadowed the negotiations, Meloni’s warring coalition put forward a united front, backing Meloni to lead the country during formal talks with President Sergio Mattarella, on Friday. Later on Friday Mattarella asked Meloni to form a government.  Meloni, after arriving for talks in a Fiat 500, accepted unconditionally, a spokesman for the president’s office said. The right-wing coalition emerged triumphant from the election, with 44 percent of the vote, led by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, which took 26 percent. But even before a government could be cobbled together, rivalry emerged inside the coalition, with allies arguing over Meloni’s unwillingness to accommodate Silvio Berlusconi’s preferred nominations in her cabinet. At the opening of the new parliament, Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, said in a note left in public view that he found Meloni “overbearing … domineering … arrogant … offensive.", "Italy has had all sorts of leaders — including Silvio Berlusconi, with his politics-as-theater approach to governing (and who six years ago discouraged a pregnant Meloni from running for mayor of Rome, saying a “mother cannot be mayor”). Meloni is hardly the first to relish political combat. But some Italians worry she’ll further polarize the country and loosen some of the restraints in society. Edith Bruck, a Holocaust survivor and poet who lives in Rome, and who has befriended Pope Francis, noted Meloni’s shorthand way for introducing herself: as a woman, a mother, an Italian and a Christian. “What is the implication of that?” Bruck said. “That she isn’t Muslim or Jewish? It all goes back to the idea that Europe is Christian and non-Christians are a threat.” Meloni’s allies see it differently. Giovanbattista Fazzolari, a Brothers of Italy senator who has known Meloni since she was a teenager, said Meloni would represent the whole country, but that there could be “exceedingly hard” clashes with entrenched powers that she judges aren’t working “for the good of the nation.” On the campaign trail, Meloni has dealt with mostly adoring crowds, plus the occasional protest group chanting “fascists” at her supporters. And she’s used even the off-script moments as evidence that she’s ready for the job.", "The ceremony took place after a week of tensions within Meloni’s coalition after partner Berlusconi boasted about his ties with Russian President Putin. Hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy’s first female prime minister amid looming questions over her coalition partners’ stance towards Russia. The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act “in the exclusive interests of the nation” – a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners – hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia’s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi – unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia’s Antonio Tajani is now the country’s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League’s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members. Another key department, the defence ministry, is going to Brothers of Italy’s co-founder and close adviser to Meloni Guido Crosetto – a defence industry expert who was head of the Federation of Italian Aerospace Companies.", "The possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election. Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.", "Heading into the 2022 Italian general election, a snap election that was called after the 2022 Italian government crisis,[78][79] it was agreed among the centre-right coalition that the leader of the party receiving the most votes would be put forward as the prime minister candidate.[80] As of July 2022, FdI was the first party in the coalition according to opinion polling,[81][82] and she was widely expected to become Prime Minister of Italy if the centre-right coalition obtained an absolute majority in Parliament, which would be the most right-wing government in the history of the Italian Republic according to some academics.[83] In an attempt to moderate herself to placate fears among those who describe FdI as neo-fascist or far right,[84] including fears within the European Commission that she could lead Italy towards Hungary under Viktor Orbán,[85] Meloni told the foreign press that Italian fascism is history. As president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020,[86] she said she shared the experiences and values of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, Likud in Israel, and the Republican Party in the United States.[87] Critics were sceptical of her claims, citing her speeches on immigration and LGBT rights.[88][89] She campaigned for lower taxes, less European bureaucracy, and a halt to immigration through a naval blockade,[90][91] saying she would put national interests first.[92][93][94]", "30] She was the second youngest-ever minister in the history of united Italy.[31] In August 2008, she invited Italian athletes to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in disagreement with the Chinese policy implemented towards Tibet; this statement was criticised by Berlusconi, as well as the foreign affairs minister Franco Frattini.[32] In 2009, her party merged with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) and she took over the presidency of the united party's youth section, called Young Italy.[31] In the same year, she voted in favour of a decree law against euthanasia.[33]  In November 2010, on behalf of the ministry, she presented a 300 million euro package called the Right to the Future. It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]", "On 25 October, Meloni gave her first official speech as Prime Minister in front of the Chamber of Deputies, before the confidence vote on her cabinet.[132][133] During her speech, she stressed the weight of being the first woman to serve as head of the Italian government.[134] She thanked several Italian women including Tina Anselmi, Samantha Cristoforetti, Grazia Deledda, Oriana Fallaci, Nilde Iotti, Rita Levi-Montalcini, and Maria Montessori, who she said, \"with the boards of their own examples, built the ladder that today allows me to climb and break the heavy glass ceiling placed over our heads\".[135][136] The government won the confidence vote with a comfortable majority in both houses.[137][138]  One of the first measures implemented by the government regarded COVID-19 and concerned with the complete removal of the COVID-19 vaccination certificate, known in Italy as the Green Pass; moreover, non-vaccinated doctors were re-integrated into service.[139] By this time, the government’s workforce vaccination mandate had been in place for over one year, rendering the edict largely symbolic. On 31 October, the government approved a decree providing for a penalty of up to six years of imprisonment for illegal parties and rallies.", "Giorgia Meloni (Italian: [ˈdʒordʒa meˈloːni]; born 15 January 1977) is an Italian politician who has been serving as the prime minister of Italy since 22 October 2022, the first woman to hold this position. A member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2006, she has led the Brothers of Italy (FdI) political party since 2014, and she has been the president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020.  In 1992, Meloni joined the Youth Front, the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist political party founded in 1946 by former followers of Italian fascism. She later became the national leader of Student Action, the student movement of the National Alliance (AN), a post-fascist party that became the MSI's legal successor in 1995 and moved towards national conservatism. She was a councillor of the Province of Rome from 1998 to 2002, after which she became the president of Youth Action, the youth wing of AN. In 2008, she was appointed Italian Minister of Youth in the fourth Berlusconi government, a role which she held until 2011. In 2012, she co-founded FdI, a legal successor to AN, and became its president in 2014.", "He succeeded in being elected by obtaining 116 votes out of 206 in the first round thanks to the support from opposition parties to the centre-right coalition.[117][118][119] Tensions further grew, in particular between Berlusconi and Meloni, whom Berlusconi described as \"patronising, overbearing, arrogant ...

On the following day, delegates from FdI, the League, FI, and Civics of Italy–Us Moderates–MAIE, announced to Mattarella they had reached an agreement to form a coalition government with Meloni as Prime Minister.[123][124] In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace, asking her to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy.[129][130][131]", "Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy’s first female prime minister, becoming the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.

Last month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.

Ramsey, meanwhile, is unavailable after becoming the father of twins on Sunday. Wales will also be without the injured teenager Ethan Ampadu, who controlled midfield when Wales thrashed Ireland 4-1 in Cardiff last month. Victory in Dublin would take Wales above Denmark to the top of their Nations League group while defeat would put them bottom.

Rob Page confirmed Bale was \"100 per cent fit and raring to go\" prior to kick-off, and his deflected free-kick helped Wales move one step closer to the 'Holy Grail'. It was credited as a Yarmolenko own goal, but who cares? For many, the greatest player that Wales has ever produced. Came close to a second but was denied by Bushchan. This was far from his best game but it was entirely fitting that he would be heavily involved in the goal which ended 64 years of hurt. A positive move to be included from the start given his aerial prowess in both boxes. Won the first ball to set up Bale in a show of his qualities from a direct approach. Regularly penalised as so often big strikers are, but was unfazed by the Spanish official's pedantry. Selflessly set up Ramsey's chance minutes after the restart.

But Allen did not allow that to impact his game as the anchorman as he had been against Austria without a lot of defensive midfield support. Fortunate not to concede a penalty when catching Yarmolenko in the box. Not always tidy on the ball but so often first to it and always in the right place when it mattered. A free spirit on the football pitch, Ramsey produced a brilliant cross from the right midway through the first half that just evaded two Welsh team-mates.

His determination to make up for his glaring miss after the interval shone through the drizzle and showed great vision to set up Bale for his second-half opportunity. Grew into the game. Zabarnyi managed to get a near-post flick which could have fallen for anyone and hit a surprised Roberts, who inadvertently cushioned it back for Hennessey.

The Brazilian “Gabriel” trio of Martinelli, Jesus and Magalhaes have not been included in Tite’s Brazil squad, which is otherwise littered with Premier League names.

This is the series for you if you’re looking for one with star power. How about seven No. 1 overall draft picks between the two teams: Sue Bird (2002), Tina Charles (2010), Jewell Loyd (2015) and Breanna Stewart (2016) for Seattle, and Kelsey Plum (2017), A’ja Wilson (2018) and Jackie Young (2019) for Las Vegas. Then there’s the fact that seven of the 22 players named to the 2022 WNBA All-Star Game represent either Seattle or Las Vegas. For the Aces, it was team captain Wilson, the game’s MVP Plum, Young, and Dearica Hamby; for the Storm, it was the other team captain Stewart, along with Bird and Loyd.", "The team that executes the best when the game is on the line and the players that can knock down shots when the pressure is at its peak could determine the outcome of this series. THE PICK Chicago in five games. These teams have played one another eight times in the past 11 months and Chicago has gone 7-1 in those games. That is a hard fact to ignore when considering which team will be the first to earn three wins over the next 12 days. Of course, by picking the Sky, I’ve added more disrespect fuel to the Sun’s collective competitive fire. As a team, Connecticut plays with a chip on it shoulder with a desire to quiet doubters on their way to success. They have a prime chance to do so in this series as they look to knock off the defending champs on their way back to the Finals.

On Tuesday, it will try to win back viewers. By Julia Jacobs Follow our live coverage of the Golden Globe Awards 2023. In 2021, actors accepted Golden Globes remotely at a time when organizers were just beginning to grapple with a growing scandal around finances, ethics and diversity in its ranks. Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the scandal, needed time to make “meaningful reform.” But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants. What is not yet clear is how many of those viewers will return, after a precipitous drop in ratings during the pandemic, and whether celebrities and other members of the industry will appear en masse. The Globes have long had a reputation for booziness and irreverence. Will the revived ceremony still be seen as a less-staid alternative to the Academy Awards? Or will the Hollywood Foreign Press take the show more seriously? Here’s a brief history of the ceremony’s downfall, how its organizers are trying to rehabilitate it and what to expect from this year’s telecast.", "By clicking Sign Up, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and that you have read our Privacy Policy.

In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies. His HBO special “Rothaniel,” in which he came out as gay, won an Emmy and was considered among the best of 2022.", "Appearing recently on NBC’s “Tonight Show,” Carmichael took aim at the network as well as the awards show, and said it was his idea — along with NBC’s “lazy and pushy” marketing team — to brand the ceremony as an “evening of joy and devastation.”  Awards  The best looks from the 2023 Golden Globes, including Ana de Armas, Viola Davis and Jenna Ortega.

It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly.  The face features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame?

Original article: After years of rumors and speculation, the Google Pixel Watch hit wrists to mixed reviews. Some details, like unique Fitbit integration and a minimalist design, knocked it out of the park. Others, like disappointing battery life, rang up short. Now just months later, we’re already looking ahead to the next season of potentially exciting wearable launches. Most importantly, we’re eager to see Google drop a second generation of its very first smartwatch to see if it can polish up the rough edges. Stay tuned to hear everything we know about the Google Pixel Watch 2 and find out what features we are most hopeful to see for the search giant’s next attempt. Ever since the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 series, the Wear OS landscape has been an exciting market to watch. Samsung kept its foot on the gas with the Galaxy Watch 5, and other companies, such as Fossil, have scrambled to keep up. When the first Pixel Watch finally landed in the fray, we accepted Google’s smartwatch as an imperfect but promising first attempt.", "27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41 mm (1.6 in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294 mAh battery and 2 GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.", "Simply reading “Pixel Watch 2” in an official-looking font, it’s unclear if it was taken from an internal Google source, or is simply a mock-up. The tweet was posted on the 9th of May, potentially hinting at an I/O reveal (the keynote took place the next day) but one never came. Let’s face it, the Pixel Watch 2 isn’t going to land until the latter half of 2023 at the earliest. The first-gen Pixel Watch is barely six months old, and Google has yet to even confirm whether it’ll see annual updates like its Pixel smartphones. With Apple and Samsung both ploughing on with new models every twelve months, though, it’s a safe bet that Google will follow suit. That means we can expect the Pixel Watch 2 to arrive in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, barring any delays.  Pricing is more of an unknown. You could pick up a Pixel Watch for £339/$350 at launch, but prices quickly dropped and now you can get one for £300/$300 with a bit of shopping around. Would a successor land at a more modest price to drum up interest? And while Google managed to match the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro‘s prices to their predecessors, the Pixel 7a arrived with a £50/$50 increase over the outgoing Pixel 6a.", "When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Google finally released its first Pixel smartwatch in 2022, impressing us with its usability and features. Now, as the sequel is due, what has the search giant got up its rather ample sleeves?  We round up all the news and rumours we’ve seen so far about the Google Pixel Watch 2.  There’s no official word yet from Google, and the Google I/O event in May 2023 came and went without any mention or tease of an update to the smartwatch range, instead only covering the Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet.  Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model arrives.", "You can read our full Pixel Watch review for all of our in-depth analysis, but the overall takeaway is that we were left with an expectation that Google is just getting started. We fully expect to see a Pixel Watch 2 in the not-to-distant future. For starters, the lineup stands out among Wear OS-based wearables with a streamlined, Google-centric user experience and unique Fitbit integration. As such, it’s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot. For example, Fitbit’s smartwatches no longer offer third-party app support, further elevating the value of a true smartwatch experience paired with Fitbit tracking features. Respected leaker Evan Blass tweeted an image containing the words “Pixel Watch 2” on May 9. It’s unclear if this image was derived from an official source. Nevertheless, this is as close as we’ve gotten to a Pixel Watch 2 confirmation given Blass’s reliability. Check out the image below. A report from 9to5Google in late May that details some of the Pixel Watch 2’s specs also appears to confirm that Google is working on a sequel to its smartwatch.

Here’s how it works Home / Features / Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch successor  The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design, slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm’s Wear OS software to date. Google’s first wearable effort wasn’t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the “one size fits all” approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon.

He later filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners in November 2017, accusing them of colluding to keep him out of the league. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019, ahead of Super Bowl LIII, after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL.[3]", "Sports rights have long been the province of traditional media companies like Fox, Disney, Paramount Global and NBCUniversal, but technology companies like Apple and Amazon have made a bigger play for those rights as they seek to bring in consumers to their broadband subscription-video services.

Japan's influential and longest-serving prime minister worked to revitalize the nation's economy — with his namesake \"Abenomics\" policy — and rebuild its role on the global stage. He was 67. Abe was giving a speech for a candidate in Nara, a city in western Japan, just ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections, when a man fatally shot him from behind with a handmade firearm. Police arrested the suspect identified as Tetsuya Yamagami, a 41-year-old unemployed former member of Japan's maritime defense force.

The suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, admitted shooting Abe with a homemade gun, and said he had a grudge against a \"specific organisation\", police said.  Several other handmade weapons, similar to those used in the attack, had been confiscated after a search of the suspect's house, police officers told a news conference. Explosives were also found at the home and police said they had advised residents to evacuate the area. The suspected shooter told officers he had a grudge against a specific group he believed Abe was connected to, police said, adding that they were investigating why the former PM was targeted out of other people related to the group. Asked by a member of the Japanese media whether the gunman's intention was to kill Abe, police say only that Mr Yamagami admitted to shooting the former PM.

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) — A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation’s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party’s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party’s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan’s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.", "Public anger at  cost of  ceremony for former PM and revelations over his party’s ties to religious group A state funeral for Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been held in Tokyo amid public anger over the cost of the ceremony and revelations over his party’s ties to a controversial religious group. More than 4,000 guests, including the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, stood in silence as a member of Japan’s self-defence forces entered the Nippon Budokan hall, where a 19-gun salute sounded in honour of the assassinated former leader. Abe’s widow, Akie, dressed in a black kimono, carried her late husband’s ashes into the hall, followed by Japan’s crown prince, Akishino, and other members of the imperial family. Abe was killed in early July by a man armed with a homemade gun who has reportedly told police that he had targeted the conservative politician over his support for the Unification church. Amid tight security, people opposed to the funeral demonstrated as thousands of mourners queued to lay flowers and offer prayers in a park near the venue. After a video showcasing Abe’s achievements, set to footage of the former prime minister playing the piano, the current leader, Fumio Kishida, paid tribute to his friend and predecessor.", "(Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP)                                                           TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan’s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and decorations.", "Recent opinion polls showed a majority of people opposed the ceremony, with many citing its ¥1.6bn ($11m) price tag. A private funeral for Abe was held in Tokyo four days after he was shot dead while making an election campaign speech in the western city of Nara on 8 July. “I know it’s divisive and there are a lot of people against this, but there were so many people lined up to offer flowers,” said Yoshiko Kojima, a 63-year-old Tokyo resident who was among the mourners on Tuesday. “I felt that now the funeral is actually taking place, many people have come out to pray for him.", "Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun. The government estimates that 23,000 mourners lined up to lay flowers at tables in front of pictures of Abe outside the hall. In a sign of the divisions surrounding the commemoration, thousands of others took to the streets in protest.

If Ser Harwin is now Rhaenyra's protector, this could be essentially an Alicent-Rhaenyra proxy fight right here. Stay tuned.

A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.", "The teaser also features the queen and the princess’ latest spat, with tempers flaring so much that Alicent publicly pulls a knife on Rhaenyra. Now that the pivotal sixth episode has made its way to air, we’re officially in the back stretch of the season. House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon’s eldest daughter. Her early demise will have consequences, considering Episode 7 is titled, “Driftmark,” which is the seat of House Velaryon. Expect plenty from Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Rhaenys (Eve Best), who’ll be trying to pick up the pieces following their daughter’s death. Episode 6 had one of the longest runtimes of the season, totaling 67 minutes. With so much to cover across the 10-year gap, a little extra time seemed necessary. But Episode 7 will serve as the shortest episode in the series so far, slated for just under an hour at 59 minutes. Episode 7 will likely revolve around the Velaryons in Driftmark. As we’ve seen in the trailer, viewers will see the funeral for Laena.", "TV & Movies House Velayron takes center stage this Sunday. House of the Dragon is getting closer to the finish line — at least for Season 1. After the 10-year time jump in Episode 6, the political landscape of Westeros has completely shifted, and Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) and Alicent (Olivia Cooke) have never been more at odds. Their bickering and slander are already seeing casualties start to stack up. If it wasn’t becoming clear already, their decade of rivalry is finally getting out of hand. With new feuds and some returning characters, here is what you can expect from House of the Dragon Episode 7, including its release date and time, plot, and trailer. House of the Dragon Episode 7 premieres on Sunday, Oct. 2. Audiences will be able to watch the episode on HBO and HBO Max at 9:00 p.m. ET (or 6:00 p.m. PT for west coast viewers).  HBO is also scheduled to broadcast Episode 6 at 7:41 p.m ET if folks need a recap before the new chapter airs. The latest trailer picks up right where Episode 6 left off, as House Velaryon holds a funeral for Laena (Nanna Blondell), sending her to a watery tomb.", "In the span of roughly 10 minutes, House of the Dragon has effortlessly caught its viewers up on a decade of missing time, established the bona fides of several new actors, and set up the central conflict for the rest of the episode and beyond. This, my friends, is how you television. Granted, the rest of “The Princess and The Queen” doesn’t quite live up to the deliriously joyful highs of its opening act but nothing really could. What follows is still a well-crafted hour that is positively dripping with raw, uncut, juicy, revolting drama.  Ad Ad – content continues below In my review of House of the Dragon episode 2, I observed that much of what makes any given episode of a Thrones show work is whether the dialogue is up to snuff. Even in episodes like this that feature countless budget-busting sequences of dragonriding, most of the action in Westeros is delivered verbally as various characters gather in various rooms to discuss various topics while the subtext of history gently roars around them. Not to pat myself on the back or anything *pats back anyway* but that observation is looking pretty good when it comes to “The Princess and The Queen.” Get the best of Den of Geek delivered right to your inbox!

Photograph by Ollie Upton / HBO We’ve rounded the halfway point on House of the Dragon season 1, HBO’s much-hyped Game of Thrones prequel series. House of the Dragon will feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place.

We’re going to lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the Rotten Tomatoes episode titles have not been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt. The only episode title HBO has confirmed is for Episode 6.

This House of the Dragon review contains spoilers. “The Princess and the Queen” is effectively a second pilot episode for House of the Dragon. The installment flashes further forward into the future than ever before and ages its characters up so severely that they may as well be entirely different people. And that’s not even to mention the nearly dozen actually new characters that the episode does introduce in the form of Queen Alicent, Princess Rhaenyra, and Prince Daemon’s respective broods of children.  The decision to jump so far down the timeline midseason is as bold a one as you’re likely to see on television. It has every reason to be a disastrous one as well. Shuffling the board to this extent halfway through a story shouldn’t work. And yet, work “The Princess and The Queen” does. This episode isn’t just an impressive technical maneuver. It’s by far the most entertaining and enriching dispatch from House of the Dragon yet.  The fresh burst of energy that “The Princess and The Queen” provides to House of the Dragon is evident from its very first scene."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Black Adam finally going into production marks another achievement for Dwayne Johnson, with the actor and Hollywood superstar having been signed on to play the role for over a decade. \"Black Adam has been with me for over ten years now. That gives you an idea of how passionate I am about this project,\" Johnson said last year of his commitment to the project. \"How passionate our Seven Bucks is about this project. Warner Bros., New Line Cinemas, DC, they have been so incredibly supportive over the years,\" Johnson continued. \"In 2008 was when we first started talking about this. So, it has required patience by all of us as partners.", "Perhaps Black Adam's Adrianna/Isis has been separated from Adam, and part of the story will feature their reunion. Right now, the film's plot is still being kept under wraps, so everything is speculation. Still, come next year, audiences just might meet the goddess Isis on the big screen.", "She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the ’70s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s. But she’s still an important figure in superhero history who rarely gets her due.", "So the idea of seeking revenge to protect your family, or to redeem the death of your loved ones, is something that I think resonates with the two of them. Adrianna was like Tomb Raider meets Indiana Jones. And so it was important not only to show just her toughness and her ability in that sense but also her vulnerabilities and the softness in her. Because she does, kind of, become the Black Adam Whisperer. To watch that transition happen and to see how they affect each other in that space was also important.”   Adrianna may not be able to shoot electricity through her eyes yet, but if Black Adam gets sequels to continue the story, that day may be coming. Isis has powers akin to Black Adam’s (superstrength, energy manipulation, flight, etc.) and control over all of the elements. Her future powers may mirror Black Adam’s but in this movie, it is the commonality of loss that unites this unlikely pair.  Vengeance is not something Steve Rogers would condone, but revenge has a long history in the world of comic book superheroism. Ghost Rider, Punisher, Deadpool, and more antiheroes have brought about positive change through grim acts of retaliation, and it sounds like Black Adam and Adrianna Tomaz are joining the cause.", "Over the years, she's had supporting roles in Person of Interest, Chicago Fire, and City on a Hill. Shahi will be seen as Adrianna Tomaz, aka Isis, in the widely anticipated DC film Black Adam. One of the film's most fascinating aspects is Black Adam's relationship with Adrianna Tomaz. Regarding her role in the film, Sarah Shahi said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Adrianna Tomaz has a brother named Karim, played by actor Mohammed Amer. Not many other plot details are known at this point, but it'll be interesting to see how Adrianna Tomaz's role as Black Adam's love interest pans out in the film. Black Adam chronicles the eventful story of the titular character who returns to the modern world after centuries of imprisonment and teams up with the Justice Society of America (JSA). Here's the official synopsis of the movie, as per DC: The film's initial reactions have been mostly positive, with praise majorly directed towards the thrilling action sequences and ambitious plot. Dwayne Johnson has received high praise from fans for his performance in the lead role. Black Adam will drop in theaters on Friday, October 21, 2022.", "Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.", "In the upcoming Dwayne Johnson flick, Black Adam, the character of Adrianna Tomaz is played by actress Sarah Shahi. Tomaz, aka Isis, was a refugee Black Adam received as a bribe from Intergang. Tomaz plays a pivotal role in Black Adam's evolution as a character. Sarah Shahi is a noted actress who's appeared in several popular TV shows and films over the years.

Sports biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of Sweetwater reads: \"The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.", "Hwy 30 W, Fort Wayne, IN 46818 Get Directions | Phone Hours | Store Hours  Explore our commitments to you  If you have any questions, please call us at (800) 222-4700  © 2023 Sweetwater - All rights reserved.

Yes, there is a trailer for Sweetwater, and it can be watched below: The themes of the film are striking throughout the trailer, with the opening line \"It ain't about the color of my skin\" resonating instantly. The dramatic score and intense dialogue set up a feeling of triumph through adversity, and it looks as if Sweetwater may just be one of the most feel-good movies hitting theaters this Spring. Every good biopic has a strong and often inspiring central character, and Sweetwater is no different. Born in Arkansas in October 1922, Nat Clifton, nicknamed \"Sweetwater\" because of his love for fizzy drinks, showed his true talent for basketball throughout his time in school. After serving in the US Army during World War II, Clifton made it back safely and began his career in professional basketball. As a member of the famous Harlem Globetrotters, Clifton would cement his legacy as an all-time great when he became only the second African-American to sign an NBA contract, just four days after Earl Lloyd. In 2014, some 24 years after his death, Clifton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, perfectly summarizing his incredible career.", "When New York Knicks executive Ned Irish and Knicks coach Joe Lapchick decide it is time for the Knicks to integrate, with the support of NBA President Maurice Podoloff, they come together with the other team owners of the league to make history.\" With Clifton as the subject, the film is likely to not just tackle his story, but themes of discrimination and a struggle for acceptance, with the decision to focus on this period of his life an apt one. So, with all that in mind, here is exactly how you can watch Sweetwater when it finally arrives on our screens. Related:10 Best Sports Movies For People Who Don't Like Sports Movies After an immensely long production period, with the film first set as \"in production\" back in 2012, the release date of this film will feel like the culmination of a saga. Recently, it was announced that Briarcliff Entertainment would release the film nationwide in theaters on April 14, 2023. So, after so long, anyone who has been following this movie's progress can finally book their tickets. Currently, there is no announced streaming release for Sweetwater, however, with sports biopics all the rage, and with Netflix in particular really getting into the genre, it is likely that, soon, the film will end up available to stream somewhere before long."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

While I hadn’t been impressed with the dozens of leaks and official renders, the $349.99 ($399.99 for LTE) Pixel Watch left a much stronger impression in person. That, and the bar for the Pixel Watch is low. This watch’s one job is to not suck. But after a week of testing, it’s fair to say I’ve tempered my expectations. The Pixel Watch is a good first attempt from Google, but the company has a lot of growing pains to work out for the next iteration of the watch. That is, assuming it doesn’t prematurely kill it off.  From the curved glass to the digital crown, Google isn’t shy that it took its design cues for the Pixel Watch from Apple.

It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly.  The face features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space.   It seems like no mistake that the Pixel Watch is a \"dark mode\" device.

The award will be presented at the foundation’s annual Heroes & History Makers celebration, on Wednesday at The Anthem in Washington, D.C., and streamed live. The event is an annual tribute to America’s 5.5 million military caregivers, the loved ones who voluntarily care for wounded, ill and injured service members and veterans at home. Former Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a Salisbury native, will be joined by Hidden Heroes Campaign Chair Tom Hanks and multi-platinum, global entertainer Chris Young. The Caregiver Champion Award was named for Hanks in recognition of his support of military caregivers. The award has previously been presented to former First Lady Michelle Obama, music superstar Tim McGraw and actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise.

And it is love that propels mothers and fathers, spouses, siblings, children — to hold them and care for them when they return, with wounds seen, and unseen.” Savannah called out by name specific caregivers she's encountered, like Colleen Rose, who nursed her husband through devastating burn injuries, and Pat Ochan, who cares for her husband and raises their son all while juggling her job and pursuing a Ph.D.", "Savannah also gave a nod to her own sister-in-law, Kristine, who raised a family while Savannah's brother served 27 years as an F16 pilot.  “Caregivers prove day in and day out, love isn’t just something you feel, it is something you do,” she added. “You inspire me. You make me want to live up to your example.

And she has gone above and beyond, with such grace and compassion, to speak directly to military caregivers and ensure them that they are not alone.” Dole was the first to call the nation’s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who served.

If you're sure about the service and want to commit for a year, there's an annual plan available for $119.99. That's two months of savings for paying upfront.  There are also two other plans available for families and students. The Family plan for YouTube Premium costs $22.99 per month. It allows you to add up to five other people (six total members) who are at least 13 years old and live in your household so they get the same benefits. Per YouTube's terms, these people must live at the same address as you. If you're a student who can provide verification (required each year), the price of the Student YouTube Premium plan is $6.99 per month instead. Whether the cost of Premium is worth it or not depends on how many of YouTube Premium's benefits you use. Keep this in mind as we look at them below, especially in relation to what other services like Spotify Premium and Netflix offer.", "Customers can air out their grievances about the YouTube Premium Family Plan price change in a dedicated feedback page that Google has created.

According to Google, for existing members, the new monthly rate will go into effect for the first billing cycle that occurs at least 30 days after customers have been notified of the price increase.  \t“We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize how hard this may be for our members,” a YouTube rep said in a statement. “This new price reflects the complete value of YouTube Premium and will allow us to develop even more Premium features and continue to support the creators and artists you watch and listen to on YouTube.”  \t               \tThe YouTube Premium Individual plan remains $11.99/month, while the Student plan (available only to eligible full-time students) is still $6.99/month.   \tYouTube Premium eliminates zero ads on all content, including music, provides downloads for offline viewing or listening as well as background playback (meaning you can continue to listen to audio if you’re using other apps or if the screen is locked).

YouTube doesn’t have anything to share today about changes to other plans, Greenberg said, but noted that the company will notify users by email at least 30 days in advance before changing the price.

The plan requires one primary account holder to serve as the family manager. The other family members can use their own Google account to access a shared YouTube paid membership. Family groups share access to YouTube Premium, YouTube Music Premium and other Google services. Spotify’s family tier, where up to six family members can access Premium account features, costs $15.99 a month in the US. For Apple Music, the family plan costs $19.95 per month. Over a month ago, YouTube’s Global Head of Music, Lyor Cohen, said the company aims to overtake Spotify as the music rights industry’s biggest partner by 2025. “That’s why YouTube is monetizing all music formats (short & long form video, audio tracks, Live, etc.), on all platforms (desktop, tablet, mobile, and TV), in over 100 countries.

A YouTube Premium family plan now costs $22.99 per month following a price hike, as reported by 9to5Google. The family tier offers benefits like ad-free viewing and background playback for you and up to five other people, and it now costs $5 more per month.  The price change is already in effect for new subscribers, meaning you can’t sign up at the previous $17.99 price any longer.

The email to subscribers read: We created YouTube Premium to provide an uninterrupted YouTube experience, so you can get closer to the videos, creators, and music artists that you love.

Starting in November, most users will start paying $22.99 per month for YouTube Premium — though there seems to be some leeway. While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to their status as a \"long-standing and valued member.\" With the new price structure, the family plan is less of a bargain for smaller groups. At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts and $6.99 for students. The benefits haven't changed either, with Premium still offering users an ad-free YouTube experience, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, access to YouTube Music, and the ability to continue to play music and videos in the background or with your phone screen off.

Some developers even shared that they were being sent unsolicited Dick Pics due to the game not revealing a release date.

Taking to Twitter, Judge stated “Ragnarok was delayed because of me” and explained that in 2019 he faced significant health issues leaving him unable to walk. The illness required “back surgery, both hips replaced, and knee surgery” as well as rehab, which Sony Santa Monica waited for him to recover from. Judge added that he received “nothing but love and support” from Sony Santa Monica, who “never said a word about the delay, and what caused it.” Grace Orlady, the senior manager of Santa Monica Studio, has already teased some key details about what we can expect from the game when it launches in a PlayStation Blog post. “As you can see in the trailer, we’re picking up a few years after the events of God of War (2018).", "23][24] The game's title was confirmed to be God of War Ragnarök during the following year's showcase event,[25] although earlier that year, the title had accidentally been leaked.[26][27][28] Although the 2018 installment was ported to Windows (PC) in January 2022, Barlog, who served as a producer and creative director for the sequel, could not confirm if Ragnarök would also receive a PC port.[29]  Development of the game was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development.[31]  The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice, supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said \"We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time\".", "If they want to go on and play the PS5 version, that game will be there for them.\" Read more on God of War: Sony kept its cards close to its chest when it comes to God of War Ragnarök's story, so we won't spoil it here, but we will say a few things about the game's narrative direction.

The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet and selects its ministers. As modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they sit as members of Parliament.  The office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[3] In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons.  The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service and the minister responsible for national security.[4]: p.22  In 2019, the office of minister for the Union was established; Boris Johnson became the first prime minister to hold this title.[5] The prime minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.[6]  Rishi Sunak has been the prime minister since 25 October 2022.[7]  The position of prime minister was not created; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective.", "Sunak — at 42 the youngest British leader in more than 200 years — acknowledged the scale of his challenge as well as the skepticism of a British public alarmed at the state of the economy and weary of a Conservative Party soap opera that has chewed through two prime ministers in as many months. “I fully appreciate how hard things are,” Sunak said outside the prime minister’s 10 Downing Street residence. “And I understand, too, that I have work to do to restore trust after all that has happened. All I can say is that I am not daunted.” Sunak immediately set about appointing a Cabinet, aiming to put his stamp on the government while bringing in people from different wings of the Conservative Party. He removed about a dozen members of Truss’ government, but kept several senior figures in place besides Hunt, including Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who resigned last week in a move that helped trigger Truss’ downfall, got her job back. A leading light of the Conservatives’ right wing, Braverman is charged with fulfilling a controversial, stalled plan to send some asylum seekers arriving in Britain on a one-way trip to Rwanda.

He had said that he had secured the backing of 102 legislators and could have been “back in Downing Street” but he had failed to persuade either Sunak or Mordaunt to come together and back him “in the national interest”. “I believe I have much to offer, but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time,” Johnson said. The Tories retain a majority in parliament, meaning that as their leader, Sunak will be named prime minister by King Charles III. Economists have questioned whether Sunak can tackle the country’s finances while holding the party’s multiple warring factions together. Finance minister Jeremy Hunt – the fourth person in that role in four months – is due to present a budget on October 31 to plug a black hole in the public finances, which is expected to have ballooned to up to 40 billion pounds ($45.2bn). Conservative political commentator Alex Deane noted that the last three Conservative prime ministers have been brought down by members of their own party. “So it’s very nice to hear people say good things about our new leader,” Deane told Al Jazeera. “[Sunak] didn’t have a direct electoral mandate,” Deane said. “… One of the things he is going to have to do … is preside over a period of relative calm, reassuring the markets and not doing anything too bold or too rapid.", "31] There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom.[32] Despite refusing \"...to discuss a hypothetical situation\" with BBC News in 2011,[33] the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:[34] There is no single protocol setting out all of the possible implications. However, the general constitutional position is as set out below. There can be no automatic assumption about who The Queen would ask to act as caretaker Prime Minister in the event of the death of the Prime Minister. The decision is for her under the Royal Prerogative. However, there are some key guiding principles. The Queen would probably be looking for a very senior member of the Government (not necessarily a Commons Minister since this would be a short-term appointment). If there was a recognised deputy to the Prime Minister, used to acting on his behalf in his absences, this could be an important factor. Also important would be the question of who was likely to be in contention to take over long-term as Prime Minister. If the most senior member of the Government was him or herself a contender for the role of Prime Minister, it might be that The Queen would invite a slightly less senior non-contender. In these circumstances, her private secretary would probably take soundings, via the Cabinet Secretary, of members of the Cabinet, to ensure that The Queen invited someone who would be acceptable to the Cabinet to act as their chair during the caretaker period.", "No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election.[40] Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.  On taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:   His Majesty the King [Her Majesty the Queen] has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.[41] Throughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3]  In 2010, the prime minister received £142,500 including a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament.[42] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.  The prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister.", "Once the Party had elected a new leader, that person would, of course, be invited to take over as Prime Minister.  Additionally, when the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout.[35]  On 6 April 2020, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted into ICU, he asked First Secretary of State Dominic Raab \"to deputise for him where necessary\".[36]  A prime minister ends their tenure by offering their resignation to the British monarch.[37] This can happen after their party has suffered a general election defeat, so that they no longer command the confidence of the House of Commons. It can also happen mid-term, if they are forced to resign for political reasons,[38] or for other reasons such as ill-health.[39] If the prime minister resigns mid-term, and their party has a majority in the Commons, the party selects a new leader according to its rules, and this new leader is invited by the monarch to become the new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister is likely to remain in post until the new leader has been chosen by the party. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a Member of Parliament. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister's Resignation Honours.", "Liz Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning most votes in the Conservative Party leadership contest, succeeding Boris Johnson who resigned in July after a series of scandals.           Truss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis.           She pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”           Monday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.

Sunak’s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. “This decision is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,” Mordaunt said in a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced. “Rishi has my full support.” Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss last month in the race to appoint a successor to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was forced to announce his resignation in July after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the UK’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multimillionaire former hedge fund boss will be expected to impose deep spending cuts to try to rebuild the UK’s fiscal reputation, just as the country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging costs of energy and food.

So, how much does Netflix with ads cost, and what’s included? Here’s what you need to know. Updated on July 19, 2023 with details on how “Basic with Ads” is now called “Standard with Ads” following the elimination of the ad-free “Basic” plan. Netflix Standard with Ads costs $6.99 a month, or $8.50 a month less than Netflix’s least expensive ad-free plan. For some context, Paramount+ and Peacock Premium (which, confusingly, is ad-supported, versus the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus) each cost $4.99 a month, while ad-supported Hulu costs $6/month. Meanwhile, HBO Max with ads goes for $10 a month, while Disney+ will charge $8 a month for its upcoming “with ads” plan. As it stands, Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plan, Standard, currently costs $15.49 a month for a single stream.

Netflix said Wednesday at its 2023 Upfront presentation that almost 5 million people are using the service's ad-supported tier, called Standard with ads (formerly it was Basic with ads). Netflix also said the number of people who've signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023.   \"More than a quarter of our signups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available,\" Greg Peters, Netflix's co-CEO, said in a news release. \"Engagement on our ads plan is similar to our comparable non-ads plans.\"  Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022. It costs less than similar plans from other streaming services, like Disney Plus and HBO Max (soon to be called just Max). These other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs $7 a month.  Netflix said Wednesday that its ad-supported plan has almost 5 million global monthly active users, which is a different measure than subscribers, since multiple people in a household can use one Netflix account.", "Netflix offers a variety of plans to meet your entertainment needs.

(Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a 720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things, which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive.

Starting Thursday, the ad plan will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. It will then launch in Spain on Nov. 10. At $6.99 per month, Netflix Basic with Ads costs less than half of Netflix’s $15.49 Standard plan and almost a third less than its ad-free $9.99 Basic plan.  In exchange for that lower price tag, subscribers who switch to the ad-supported plan will have to watch an average of five minutes of ads per hour that are set to play before and during movies and TV shows. At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length. During an October press call, Netflix chief operating officer and product chief Greg Peters said that new movies coming to Netflix “will just have a pre-roll” of ads followed by an uninterrupted viewing experience in order to “preserve that cinematic model.” He added that movies that have “been on the service for a while” will have a more “traditional” mix of pre-roll and mid-roll ads.

Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September — an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes.

It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts.

To round things out, it’s also the decade in which Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) and Prince Charles’ marriage finally fully crumbled.  But despite the grim times depicted on-screen, Jonny Lee Miller, who plays Prime Minister John Major this season, is also eager to get the new episodes in front of audiences. “I’m always excited for things to come out and for people to see them,” he said on the carpet. “That’s the whole point.

By Radhika Seth and Kerry McDermott The next installment of Netflix’s big-budget, awards-laden original series is expected to cover the early to mid-1990s, a period in which the marriage of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, was rapidly disintegrating. Yes. On October 20, Netflix released the first official trailer for The Crown Season 5—and it’s a scorcher. It opens with a shot of Windsor Castle in flames (a fire ravaged the royal residence during the Queen’s annus horribilis in 1992) and then shows Imelda Staunton as the monarch, examining its ashen remains. “In light of the events of the last 12 months, perhaps I have more to reflect on than most,” she muses in voiceover. Also featured? Elizabeth Debicki’s Princess Diana and Dominic West’s Prince Charles looking stony-faced during a meeting with the Queen; the latter confronting her son about his ongoing affair with Olivia Williams’s Camilla Parker Bowles; Diana seemingly reaching breaking point and taking off her famous sapphire and diamond engagement ring; and later donning her famous “revenge dress.", "Imelda Staunton Dominic West Jonny Lee Miller Elizabeth Debicki Claudia Harrison Gillian Anderson Claudia Harrison From left: Teddy Hawley, Elizabeth Debicki and Timothee Sambor Marcia Warren Prasanna Puwanarajah Dominic and Senan West Jude Akuwudike Jonathan Pryce Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic West Peter Morgan James Murray Prasanna Puwanarajah Marcia Warren Teddy Hawley Elizabeth Debicki From left: Elizabeth Debicki, Dominic West, Imelda Staunton and Jonathan Pryce Khalid Abdalla Elizabeth Debicki Olivia Williams Peter Morgan Elizabeth Debicki Lesley Manville Elizabeth Debicki Jonathan Pryce Imelda Staunton Lesley Manville Salim Daw and Khalid Abdalla What keeps the show fair and fascinating in Staunton’s eyes is that everyone involved in the production handles the story with great care. “Peter Morgan always wants to be respectful and give all the characters dignity and empathy, and let the audience imagine what it’s like being that family who, day in, day out, just went to work every day,” said the actor who portrays Queen Elizabeth II herself. “I think the outpouring of gratitude that was shown at the queen’s funeral was to do with her ability to just keep working every day.” The Crown Season 5 premieres on Netflix on Nov. 9. 2016 The actor teases what to expect come Nov.", "/vQrGU9pCRy The official poster for season 5 also has Diana and Charles in the forefront, hinting at the season's focus on their marriage with the logline, \"A house divided.\" While the couple stand at the edges of the frame, out of focus, Queen Elizabeth (Imelda Staunton) stands firm in full focus, as the center of the family. Netflix previously released a dispatch from the set of The Crown in September 2021, along with a tentative premiere month. In the clip from the streamer's fan event, Tudum, Imelda Staunton introduces herself as the show's new Queen Elizabeth II, while paying tribute to previous queens Olivia Colman and Claire Foy. \"On behalf of the cast and crew, we look forward to bringing you the next season of The Crown in November 2022,\" she says. We now also have the official trailer for the season. Soundtracked by a moody rendition of The Verve's \"Bitter Sweet Symphony,\" the clip begins with a brief mention of the 1992 Windsor Castle Fire, before it focuses on the conflict raging within the family, as Princess Diana separates from Charles and The Firm attempts to keep her from speaking out.  New images from The Crown's forthcoming season show a brand-new cast completely transforming into members of the royal family.", "\"As we started to discuss the storylines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,\" Peter Morgan said in a statement.   And with Season 6 slated to bring the story into the early 2000s, per Variety, that means Season 5 could cover the late '90s; but that's yet to be confirmed.    The Crown was meant to last for six seasons from the start. After the show first debuted, Netflix's head of content, Ted Sarandos, said in 2016, \"The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years.\" Sarandos's plan seemed to be further solidified in October 2019, when show creator Peter Morgan signed a massive overall deal with Netflix. Sources had told Deadline that the agreement would include two more seasons of The Crown following Season 4. After all the back and forth, we're back to Plan A.  Just as the cast was updated after the first two seasons, the show is doing the same by the time it arrives to Season 5.

With production beginning this summer, Season 5 likely won't arrive to Netflix until 2022, Deadline previously reported. The delay wasn't caused by the coronavirus pandemic, however. Apparently, the break was planned all along.  After Season 4 debuted last fall, fans will have to wait more than a year for the next installment. Of course, this isn't the first time The Crown has taken a long break; there was a two-year wait between Seasons 2 and 3 too.   Although Netflix announced in January 2020 that The Crown's fifth season would be its last, months later, the streamer confirmed that the series would in fact get one more chapter.", "Child actors Teddy Hawley and Will Powell will portray Prince Harry as he grows up in the ’90s, while Timothee Sambor and Senan West will do the honors for Prince William (Senan also happens to be the son of Dominic West). To date, each installment of The Crown has spanned approximately a decade. The fifth season was initially expected to be the show’s final installment and take the royals from the early ’90s into the 2000s, however showrunner Peter Morgan later changed his mind, deciding instead to split the events of the decade into two seasons. “As we started to discuss the storylines for series five, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said. With that in mind, Season 5 is likely to begin in the early ’90s and end somewhere in the middle of that decade. By Hannah Coates By Alexandra Macon By Hannah Jackson The first half of the ’90s was particularly tumultuous for the Queen, with plenty of incidents that are ripe for dramatization.

Midterm elections historically hurt the president’s party. In 18 of the last 20 elections the president’s party lost ground in the House. Redistricting played a significant role in the 2022 House elections. New lines altered the competitiveness in numerous districts, and some incumbents ran for re-election in the new territory. After the 2020 Census, state legislatures or commissions drew congressional district lines. Both parties filed lawsuits to challenge these new maps. Republicans controlled line-drawing in far more districts than Democrats and, as a result, gained more seats in the House from redistricting alone. Midterms are generally viewed as a referendum on the president. With low approval ratings and high inflation, the Biden administration’s politics, policies, and polling shaped the national atmosphere. The results of the 2022 midterms held true to form, with the opposing party gaining House majority.

Many newer members have expressed support for paving the way for a new, likely younger Democrat to take the helm of the caucus. The current caucus chair, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is expected to run for the post as minority leader if Pelosi decides to retire. But Democrats' strong performance in the midterms has frozen any movement to replace Pelosi. She says some of her colleagues are urging her to run again for the top leadership post, and says the attack on her husband Paul Pelosi roughly 10 days before the election will impact her decision. Before Republicans take control of the chamber, Congress is already preparing for a lame duck session that is expected to stretch into the end of the year. Leaders hope to finalize a bipartisan budget deal to fund government agencies through the rest of the fiscal year and avoid a possible government shutdown. Pelosi also indicated that she would like Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid any contentious debate and threat of default early next year. Democratic leaders also plan to pass legislation that would clarify how Congress certifies the results of presidential elections with a revamp of the Electoral Count Act, a law first enacted in 1887. Confusion over provisions of the law was exploited by Trump and his allies on Jan.", "A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change.

If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden’s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.  The majority of House districts aren’t competitive, thanks to a redistricting process that allows state legislatures to draw their own congressional lines if they decide to. Many legislatures draw lines to give advantages to one party or the other.

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.", "This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden’s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%. Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House’s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican’s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president’s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton’s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden’s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama’s rating in 2010. That year, Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year’s midterms. After each census, congressional district lines are redrawn. This Nov. 8 election was the first general election since the redistricting process concluded.", "Although election ‘red wave’ did not happen, GOP flipped enough seats to win slim majority in House of Representatives. United States Republicans have regained control of the House of Representatives, securing a narrow majority in a midterm election that saw the party fail to meet expectations. The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California’s 27th congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since 2019. Although the much-anticipated “red wave” of Republican victories did not materialise, Republican candidates were able to gain at least five House seats in the November 8 midterms, wiping out the Democrats’ thin majority.  Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states. Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the country.

In another key race, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak lost his reelection bid to his Republican challenger, sheriff Joe Lombardo, on Friday night.

Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.  Those categories accounted for nearly 90% of the vote in 2020’s presidential election.  The counties to watch are Clark (anchored by Las Vegas) and Washoe (which includes Reno).", "REUTERS/David Swanson Democrats scored a significant upset on Saturday with a projected victory in Washington's 3rd congressional district, where Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Trump-endorsed Joe Kent. In Nevada, Democrat Cisco Aguilar won the race to be the state's next secretary of state, the top election official. He defeated Jim Marchant, a Republican who supported Trump's false claim that he lost the 2020 election to Biden because of voter fraud. Democrats also defeated Republican candidates in Michigan and Arizona who had supported Trump's false claim and sought to be their state's top elections officials. Democrats got an important boost late on Friday when Kelly, the Democratic senator for Arizona, was projected to hold onto his seat, defeating Republican Blake Masters, who like Laxalt was endorsed by Trump. Masters has not conceded the race. \"We've seen the consequences that come when leaders refuse to accept the truth and focus more on conspiracies of the past than solving the challenges that we face today,\" Kelly, a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut, said in a short victory speech to his supporters in Phoenix on Saturday.

It additionally reached number three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.  The meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]  Upon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.

Initially, Davies revealed Yasmin Finney (Heartstopper) as the new companion, whose name is once again Rose. Viewers initially assumed Finney was meant for both the 60th anniversary and beyond. But with three specials, which Gatwa may not be a significant part of, it seems her time is Tennant-based. The actual companion paired with Gatwa will be Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson (Coronation Street). A post shared by Doctor Who (@bbcdoctorwho) Gibson, 18, is officially the youngest companion the show has featured to date. (Before her, Fourth and Fifth Doctor companion Adric, played by 19-year-old Matthew Waterhouse, was the youngest ever.) This is notable for several reasons, but the biggest is that the companion is usually the audience avatar. With a literal teenager as the Doctor's companion, it seems like Davies is hoping to reboot the show for Generation Z, a theory backed by the decision to pull it off of BBC America after more than a decade and put the series on the much younger-skewing Disney+. Filming for Doctor Who Season 14 is expected to get underway at Bad Wolf Studios in Cardiff in the coming weeks.", "In the third series, Barrowman receives a title credit for his return to the show alongside permanent cast member Freema Agyeman, and in series four Agyeman is restored to the opening titles for her return arc as Martha Jones. Series four also gives Agyeman, Piper, Barrowman, and Elisabeth Sladen title billing for their reappearances in the final two-parter. Clarke also reprises his role in the series four finale; although listed as a companion alongside the other actors on the BBC Doctor Who website,[6] Clarke is not credited in this way. In \"The End of Time\", John Simm receives title billing for his antagonist role as the Master, ahead of Bernard Cribbins as companion Wilfred Mott. In subsequent years, Claire Skinner, Nick Frost and Mark Gatiss have received title credits in special episodes for roles that are not considered companions, as does Piper for her non-companion return in \"The Day of the Doctor\".  Companions in the new series also have a more flexible tenure than their classical predecessors. Several companion characters have returned to the series after leaving the Doctor's company, most notably in the Series Four finale \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008), which features a record eight past, present and future companions: Donna is joined by a returning Rose, Martha, Jack, Sarah Jane, and Mickey, while past companion K9 and future companion Wilfred Mott make appearances.", "The TARDIS has a new passenger. The BBC announced today that actress Millie Gibson has been cast on the British science fiction show Doctor Who as the titular time-traveler's new companion, or partner-in-adventures, Ruby Sunday. Gibson, 18, will star opposite Ncuti Gatwa, who is playing the Fifteenth Doctor. Gibson will make her debut on the show over the 2023 Christmas season. Her previous credits include the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honored to be cast as the Doctor's companion,\" Gibson said in a statement. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa's side, I just can't wait to get started.\" \"Millie just is the companion,\" said Gatwa. \"She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail the universe with Millie!", "Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.", "In the long-running BBC television science fiction programme Doctor Who and related works, the term \"companion\" refers to a character who travels or shares adventures with the Doctor. In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions (often to help the audience understand too) and getting into trouble; also by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as their \"friends\" or \"assistants\"; the British press have also used the latter term.  In the earliest episodes of Doctor Who, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities.[1]  The protagonists were schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who provided the audience's point of view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds. Ian in particular served the role of the action hero. The fourth character was the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who (though initially presented as an \"unearthly child\") was intended[citation needed] as an identification figure for younger viewers.", "The 13th Doctor referred to this full TARDIS as her “fam,” and in the big finale episode – “The Power of the Doctor” — several companions from previous eras joined the adventure, too. But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10.

And, on November 18, 2022, the BBC revealed that Millie Gibson will join Gatwa as the new companion.

Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year?

Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well—as was Neal's band.

Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night’s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill at Saturday night’s reception at the White House. That independent New York-based female-founded brand gained international attention after First Lady Jill Biden wore a blue tweed coat with velvet lapels and a coordinating dress from the previously little-known brand.  \t           \tNaomi Biden’s bridal choices stand to impact future brides, since high-profile weddings routinely create fashion trends and interest in the labels that were worn.", "Also, the start of the peak season for engagements — Thanksgiving through New Year’s — is nearing with 19 percent of all engagements happening in December. The bridal market continues to bounce back, as many couples who had postponed or rescheduled weddings during the pandemic are going forward — and often splurging — with their celebrations. Globally, bridalwear is expected to generate $61.1 billion in sales this year and increase to $69.9 billion in volume by 2026.     \tNaomi Biden, who earned her undergraduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania and a law degree from Columbia University, lived in New York for a stretch before relocating to the Beltway, where she and Neal have been living at the White House.

The president’s granddaughter wore a stunning Chantilly lace gown on the big day. Handout / Getty Images  On November 19, 2022, Naomi Biden married Peter Neal on the South Lawn of the White House, making it the first wedding held at the presidential residence in almost a decade. Their wedding venue wasn’t the only show-stopping detail that gained media recognition: President Joe Biden’s granddaughter donned an outfit for her big day that made bridal fashion history, and everyone took note.    The blushing bride radiated timeless elegance in a custom long-sleeve Chantilly lace wedding dress with a mock neck and organza floral embroidery made by Ralph Lauren. Although her dress resembled the bridal silhouettes that Nicky Hilton, Pippa Middleton, and Grace Kelly wore, what really took her ensemble to the next level was a sweeping cathedral-length veil made of silk organza, featuring a custom Chantilly lace border and embroidery. The bride kept it simple with her accessories, which included Tiffany & Co. diamond and pearl drop earrings and a wedding band by the same jewelry designer. A bouquet of white blooms and greenery gave her outfit the perfect classic touch.   Prior to the big day, there was a lot of speculation about which designer Biden would select for her wedding. The quintessential American fashion designer has been a staple for the bride, which made it a natural choice.", "“That was a big, big yes, because they’ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.”  When Biden and Moon visited O’Neill’s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. “[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.", "Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden‘s recent nuptials have gone down in history as the first wedding of a grandchild of a sitting US president at the White House. And now, photos exclusive to Vogue reveal that an Arab designer was a major part of the bride’s big day. While she wore a Grace Kelly-inspired wedding gown by American brand Ralph Lauren to exchange vows with Peter Neal, Biden slipped into a sleek dress from Lebanese designer Reem Acra’s namesake label for the reception and cake-cutting ceremony. Photo: Norman Jean Roy The ivory Mikado silk gown created by Beirut-born Acra came with a delicate strapless neckline, and was made notably special with pearls belonging to Biden’s grandmother Roberta Buhle sewn into the sweeping six-foot train. Biden paired the dress with pearl jewelry of her own, and sheer gloves. Acra was also the designer of choice for First Lady Jill Biden, who wore two dresses from the brand on the day: A custom couture silk chiffon vintage blue dress with a teal wool crepe coat for the ceremony and a gold embroidered seafoam blue dress for the black-tie reception.

By the end of the day, Argentina and Poland had just a point between them. Here's everything that happened in the 2022 FIFA World Cup today. Saudi Arabia 2, Argentina 1 Argentina is still alive in the tournament after Tuesday's shocking result. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends for La Albiceleste. History tells us that making out of the group stage is incredibly difficult when you lose your first game, let alone winning the World Cup — only Spain (2010) has accomplished the latter. Argentina's next opponents, Mexico and Poland, are beatable, but as we saw Tuesday, so is Argentina. It's not all good news for Saudi Arabia either. Ironically, it might have even more pressure to get results against Mexico and Poland than before now that qualifying for the knockout stages is a real possibility. But for now, Saudi Arabia is reeling in the fact that it beat one of the tournament favorites, and arguably the greatest player of all time.

I think he was punished enough He did a very bad thing. He was fired and no one came to his defense, that said all. The character was great, apparently the actor no so much.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn’t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven’t been keeping track of Paramount+’s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

It is the 16th season or a new series ?? I am really upset it will be on Paramount plus as I can’t afford more money on our cable bill., as my husband and I are retired.

In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to Rhule's record at Temple University and Baylor University as \"evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska.\" Rhule was most recently the head coach for the NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a 2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015. In his last season with Temple, Rhule led the team to a 10-3 record and an American Athletic Conference championship — the first football conference title in 49 years for the school.", "The Huskers' most recent conference championship came in 1999 under Osborne's successor, Frank Solich. Bill Callahan, Bo Pelini and Mike Riley followed before the program bottomed out under Scott Frost, who was 16-31 in four-plus seasons and never finished higher than fifth in the Big Ten West. Rhule's arrival came three days after the Huskers closed a 4-8 season under Mickey Joseph -- named interim coach after Frost's firing Sept. 11 -- and just a few months before the opening of Nebraska's $165 million football facility. \"There's not a game that I expect to ever walk into where we don't expect to win,\" Rhule said. \"It is not a burden but a responsibility on me as the coach to know that there will be people from all across the state who take the money that they've made with their hands and with their work and their daily toil -- and they spend it to come watch our team play.

Fans are invited to gather at Gate 20 on the east side of Memorial Stadium at 12:50 p.m. to welcome Rhule to campus. A special viewing of the press conference will be offered inside Memorial Stadium. Fans can also watch the introduction online. Rhule was announced as the new head coach on Nov. 26 by Trev Alberts, vice chancellor and director of athletics.  The 47-year-old Rhule has built an impressive coaching resume over the past 25 seasons with experience at both the collegiate and professional levels. Rhule has served as a head coach for the past 10 years, including seven seasons in the collegiate ranks and three seasons in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers. Alberts said success as the head coach at Temple and Baylor provides evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska. \"It is a privilege to welcome Coach Matt Rhule, his wife Julie, and their family to Nebraska,\" Alberts said. \"Coach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program.", "Nebraska finished the season 4-8 after its upset of Iowa. Alberts was in attendance at Iowa City. The second-year Nebraska AD, originally from Eastern Iowa, traveled separately from the Huskers to attend the final game of the season. An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule’s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He’s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he’s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he’s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN’s “College GameDay” that he grew up “revering” the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. — Sherman He’s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska — which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long. Rhule emphasizes physical play. His track record at Temple and Baylor backs it up. Nebraska talked a big game about physicality under Frost, but its play on the field belied that message.", "At Baylor, Rhule posted one win in his first season in 2017, then gained a 7-6 record in 2018. He marked an 11-3 record in his final season with the Bears in 2019, including a trip to the Big 12 Championship game. Rhule made the move to the NFL in 2020, where he coached the Carolina Panthers until October 2022, when he was fired for a lackluster start to the season. He has roots in the Big Ten as a former linebacker for Penn State. Rhule said he's looking forward to focusing on the college game again. \"It is a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,\" he said. \"When you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football, Nebraska is right at the top of the list.  The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field.

Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.\" Rhule is taking the helm following the firing of Scott Frost and the promotion of Mickey Joseph as interim coach. Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 – the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year before getting fired. Frost’s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn’t made a bowl game since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation’s five biggest conferences. Alberts previously said following the announcement of Frost’s firing that expectations may be lower. “We will stop talking about championships or stop talking about things we used to do,” he said.", "Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football.

After a quiet two-and-a-half month national search, Alberts landed on Rhule as the replacement for Scott Frost. This comes one day after reports from ESPN reporter Chris Low that the two parties were set to finalize a deal.  Rhule will be returning to the collegiate ranks from the NFL after a stint as the head coach in Carolina. Despite being fired from the Panthers, Rhule has a recent track record of NCAA success, rebuilding Temple and Baylor.  “Coach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program,” Alberts said in a release. “Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football.

It’s also unclear what the hire means for interim head coach Mickey Joseph and Nebraska’s assistants.  Rhule will have a tall task ahead of him. Neither of the last two head coaches in Lincoln left with a winning record, and no coach has left on his own volition since Tom Osborne retired 25 years ago.

Adams much prefers to let his performances do the talking—a commanding presence that spurred U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter to make him America’s youngest World Cup captain since Walter Bahr in 1950. “Tyler’s a guy that’s just mature beyond his years,” Berhalter said on Sunday. “Teammates know exactly what they’re going to get from him. They know that he’s going to go out on the field and compete … He’s a guy that people get behind.” Adams grew up around 50 miles north of New York City in Wappingers Falls, a quaint upstate village of antique stores and redbrick coffee shops. He began playing with the New York Red Bulls youth academy at 12 years old, though like many teens, continued to play multiple sports. He credits basketball for imbuing his all-action, box-to-box soccer technique.  “You literally spend most of your life outdoors where I’m from,” Adams told TIME in an exclusive interview Nov. 3. “I don’t remember my mom ever allowed me to be inside. I have three brothers so we’re always doing something cool.", "And we have the opportunity to begin to define ourselves at this World Cup,\" said team manager Gregg Berhalter in a Wednesday interview on the podcast Men in Blazers.  The USMNT's first match comes Nov. 21 against Wales, followed by a marquee Nov. 25 matchup with England, after which comes a Nov. 29 match with Iran to round out the team's difficult draw in the group stage.  The team's biggest star is Christian Pulisic, the standout 24-year-old forward who has long borne the hopes of a USMNT turnaround — along with the nickname \"Captain America.\" Pulisic, who plays for Chelsea, shone during the World Cup qualifying matches: His five goals included a hat trick in a 5-1 rout of Panama earlier this year.  Other young stars who the team will turn to for offensive production are Weston McKennie, the 24-year-old Juventus midfielder, and a pair of Leeds United youngsters – midfielder Tyler Adams, 23, and Brenden Aaronson, 22, a forward whose energetic play style has made him a favorite with fans.  \"We're an aggressive team, a high-pressing team. We want to use the ball. And we're going to find out if we can be successful doing that,\" Berhalter said in a panel interview after the roster announcement.", "His emotional control and composure are a huge part of what he does.  \"He is not afraid to 'carry the water', to do the dirty work, to really grind. His communication style is not all big speeches, it's very one-to-one. He listens as much as he talks. And he can communicate nonverbally, because people pick up on that better.\" Walker didn't instantly concur with the method Berhalter chose in allowing his players to pick the World Cup captain but says the coach \"wore me down.\" He made the point that such a democratic way of choosing a leader only works if the culture of your group is strong. The longer this tournament progresses, the more united this USA squad appears. \"Tyler is the perfect captain for this group,\" Walker added. \"He is one of them. It is remarkable to think, he's the same age as (Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback) Trevor Lawrence. He's younger than (current Steelers QB) Kenny Pickett. He's younger than the Michigan punter. This could be an NCAA team by age, and their main leader reflects that.\" Christian Pulisic is the best-known U.S. player and has the nickname \"Captain America\" at Chelsea, but Adams' role and spot on the field are better suited to the captaincy.", "Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32 career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32 Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way.\" Adams debuted for the Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB Leipzig."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Costco (COST) is the 11th annual Yahoo Finance Company of the Year (COTY). And a deserving one. But a look back at the list of prior winners contains a sobering lesson: greatness doesn’t always last. Our first COTY selection, for example, was Gap (GPS), in 2012. Believe it or not, the denim retailer was enjoying a resurgence back then, with the stock surging from 2011 to 2014. Since then, however, Gap has become the poster child for the old-school retail apocalypse, closing hundreds of stores, churning through CEOs and even inking a regrettable deal with one of the incarnations of Kanye West. Since peaking in 2014, the shares are down nearly 70%. Another stumbler, our 2013 selection, Disney (DIS), is still a blue-chip firm. But it hit a rough patch under the leadership of now-departed CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor, Bob Iger, is now at the helm once more, and he has a lot of fixing to do. Profits are well below pre-Covid levels and the stock is down 35% this year, more than twice the drop in the S&P 500 stock index.

It was built for enterprises that needed a video chat platform for virtual meetings. While the company wasn’t marketed as an option for everyday people to replace the likes of Skype or FaceTime, it has done exactly that. It was Zoom’s ease of use — send a link and you’re in a chat — that helped win over companies seeking a video communications tool for their employees. And as the pandemic spread from country to country, users began jumping on Zoom not only to do work, but also to spend time with coworkers, friends, and family. Zoom measures user numbers by customers with more than 10 employees, and those that paid more than $100,000 in the last 12 months. The company started the year with 74,100 customers with more than 10 employees and saw that number increase to 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees by the end of November. Revenue increased from $166.6 million in fiscal Q3 2020 to $777.", "Costco Wins Yahoo Finance's 2022 \"Company of the Year\" Award: In a year of eye-popping inflation for everything from gas to eggs hammering households, Costco played the role of trusted friend. The retail warehouse giant opted not to raise the cost of a membership even as rival Sam’s Club did. Costco served up some of the cheapest gas prices in town when prices at the pump were sizzling in the summer months. The company was often the last grocer to raise prices on household essentials despite biting price hikes from vendors. To top it off, the Issaquah, Washington based retailer kept the price of its legendary $1.50 hot dog intact and continued to offer employees among the best compensation packages in all of retail. For its efforts, Costco was rewarded with impressive sales gains seemingly every month of the year, a stock price that relatively out-performed the S&P 500 and Yahoo Finance’s coveted “Company of the Year” award. The headlines for online-car buying platform Carvana (CVNA) haven’t been good recently. And whether the company will remain a public entity is now in doubt.  In fact my colleague Rick Newman wrote a column dubbing it Yahoo Finance’s “Worst Company of the Year.” Despite a stock down XX% this year, concerns over its debt load, and weather management has the know-how to right the business, it seems one thing may actually stick around - the trend of buying used cars online.", "It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today. Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion. Other Company of the Year setbacks? Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up.

Still, Zoom has become the app used by everyone from the Federal Reserve to everyday Americans trying to keep their social lives afloat. In its most recent quarter, Zoom saw year-over-year revenue growth of 367%, with the number of customers who spent more than $100,000 in the trailing 12 months growing 136% year-over-year. And investors have been watching. Zoom’s stock price has skyrocketed in the last 12 months, jumping an incredible 475% from $71.90 in January to $410.01 as of the close of markets on Dec. 4. It’s for all of those reasons that Zoom is Yahoo Finance’s 2020 Company of the Year.

Despite the blowback, Zoom’s stock price, which topped out at $151.70 in late March just as the controversy was taking off, recovered by late April. But the question for Zoom, like many of the so-called “work-from-home” companies, remains how it will continue to exceed investors’ expectations? We’ve already seen Zoom’s stock price fall from $500.11 on Nov. 6 to $376.01 on Nov. 10, the day after Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their joint COVID-19 vaccine was 90% effective in testing. Zoom’s stock took an additional hit on Nov. 30, when it reported its Q3 2021 earnings.

If you're not part of that select club, there's no bailout coming your way—even as a sagging economy eats into private retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security looms on the brink of insolvency.

Henri Camara scored a golden goal in the 104th minute to send the west Africans to the quarter-finals. In the last eight, they were defeated by a golden goal from Turkey, but left South Korea and Japan having won many hearts. Ghana in 2010 came even closer to the semi-finals than their two predecessors. They were the only African team to get through the groups that year, and just as it did with Cameroon and Senegal their round-of-16 game went to extra time — where Asamoah Gyan scored the winner against the United States. In the quarter-final against Uruguay, with the scores tied at 1-1 in the 120th minute, Luis Suarez deliberately handled the ball on the line to deny Ghana a goal. He was sent off but Gyan, under unbearable pressure, hit the bar from the resulting penalty and let Uruguay off the hook. The South Americans won the penalty shootout and Ghana were out — to the dismay of all neutrals. 2022: Morocco Morocco became the first African side to make the World Cup semi-finals on Saturday after a controlled victory over Portugal. They topped their group in Qatar (ahead of Croatia, Belgium and Canada) and then beat former world champions Spain on penalties in the round of 16.", "Nonetheless, the final was contested by two European teams.[68] In another World Cup first, the two finalists from the preceding tournament, Italy and France, were eliminated at the group stage, with Italy becoming the third defending champions to be eliminated in the first round after Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.[76] New Zealand, one of the lowest-ranked teams, surprised many by drawing all three of their group matches, ending the tournament as the only undefeated team.                    All times listed are South African Standard Time (UTC+02)  The knockout stage comprised the 16 teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shootout to determine who progressed to the next round.[82]  In this round, each group winner (A-H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.  The round was marked by some controversial referees' decisions, including:", "World Cup 13  Morocco have become the first African team to ever make the semi-finals of the World Cup after their sensational victory over Portugal on Saturday. African countries have been competing at the World Cup since 1934 — Egypt withdrew in 1930 after missing their connecting ship to Uruguay as a result of a storm — and have made a total of 49 appearances in the competition. Advertisement Those appearances have been made up of 13 different countries, from Morocco and Tunisia in the north to South Africa at the very southern tip of the continent. The Athletic takes a look at Africa’s rich history at the World Cup and how each of these teams has fared.", "Preliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).  All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).  The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.", "The continent’s representatives would have to punch above their weight in Qatar as no African nation has made it past the last-eight of the World Cup. There has been an unmistakable glass ceiling over Africa at football World Cups. In reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon set a benchmark that has not been bettered yet. Senegal and Ghana also reached the last-eight, in 2002 and 2010 respectively, but the continent’s tale of the tape on the global stage has been one of relative underachievement. Powered by Roger Milla’s swivelling hips and a fearless athleticism, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions were the shining light of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Wins over holders Argentina, Romania and Colombia set the bar high and, for the first time, an African side claimed three wins at a World Cup. That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize. Amid a hail of falling seeds early on, the team set out its stall by beating reigning champions France and becoming the first African team to go through a World Cup group stage undefeated. They were ultimately undone by fatigue and a golden goal, but that success launched the mainstream appeal of Senegalese football.", "So one reason Africa is yet to win a World Cup is that it has barely been participating. Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.", "Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time after Luis Suárez controversially handled the ball on the line.  The Netherlands qualified for the final for the third time with a 3–2 win over Uruguay. Spain reached their first ever final with a 1–0 victory over Germany. As a result, it was the first World Cup final not to feature at least one of Brazil, Italy, Germany or Argentina.  Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to secure third place. Germany holds the record for most third-place finishes in the World Cup (4), while Uruguay holds the record for most fourth-place finishes (3).  The final was held on 11 July 2010 at Soccer City, Johannesburg. Spain defeated the Netherlands 1–0, with an extra time goal from Andrés Iniesta. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116').[88] The win gave Spain their first World Cup title, becoming the eighth team to win it. This made them the first new winner without home advantage since Brazil in 1958,[89] and the first team to win the tournament after having lost their opening game.[68]  A large number of fouls were committed in the final match.", "At this World Cup, Tunisia secured a famous victory over defending champions France and Ghana avenged their agonising exit in 2010 by helping to knock Uruguay out. 1986: Morocco, 1994: Nigeria, 1998: Nigeria, 2006: Ghana, 2014: Nigeria & Algeria, 2022: Senegal African countries have gone out in the second round of the World Cup seven times. Morocco in 1986 became the first team from the continent to get past the first round and Nigeria were the first side to do so twice in 1998. Advertisement Morocco topped their group in 1986 — ahead of England, Poland and Portugal. They beat the Portuguese 3-1 in their final group game — the only time they had beaten them before Saturday in Qatar. The north African team then lost 1-0 to eventual finalists West Germany in the last 16, with an 88th-minute Lothar Matthaus goal sending them home from Mexico. Algeria also faced Germany in the last 16 in 2014. They took the eventual winners to extra time and the world was treated to 30 minutes of gripping drama that saw three goals and the Germans triumph 2-1.

Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime.

Including their elimination, African teams have fallen in the first round 38 times. However, even when African sides have bowed out early it has rarely been without incident. Some notable highlights have been Zaire reportedly not knowing the rules for a free kick in 1974, Roger Milla dancing by the corner flag in 1990 and South Africa’s Siphiwe Tshabalala’s opening goal in the 2010 tournament — the only one to be held in Africa — resulting in a continent exploding in joy."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

We need to build a sustainable model for college athletics and that’s going to take the ability to engage and motivate Congress to enact legislation that helps modernize the support we offer our student athletes.” Livingstone outlined the association’s needs at the start of the search. She said that feedback from the membership indicated a need to: The NCAA’s 20-person board of governors made the hire. In addition to the needs outlined by Livingstone, a formal job description highlighted this period of “unprecedented change” in college athletics, both legal and legislative. The description summed up the search by saying the NCAA sought a “once-in-a-generation, transformational leader … who believes in education and intercollegiate athletics.” The NCAA’s seven-person search committee, which was formed earlier this year when Emmert announced that he was stepping aside, was made up of mostly university presidents across all three divisions of the governing body.", "Charlie Baker has been NCAA president for less than two weeks, but he knows he is coming into his role in the governing body of major college sports during a tumultuous time.           Baker, most recently the governor of Massachusetts, said his friend Utah Sen. Mitt Romney described the transition from leader of a state to leader of a rule-making organization for student-athletes nationwide as “going from the frying pan and into the fire.”           “I don’t think the people who say it is going through a tumultuous time are exaggerating. I mean, that’s the reason I took the job,” said Baker in his first televised interview since replacing Mark Emmert on March 1. “I could have done a lot of other things that would be a lot easier.”           As NCAA president, Baker will oversee an organization for 520,000 athletes, 19,000 teams and 1,100 schools in three divisions.           On the first day of the men’s basketball tournament, Baker –  who played basketball at Harvard – discussed with CNN’s Chris Wallace the challenges of the job, including rules on transgender athletes; gender equity; how student-athletes can profit from the use of their names, images and likeness (NIL) and transfers.           And he also told CNN why he thinks there’s so much excitement for March Madness.", "Media Center 4/26/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J. DeGioia announced by mutual agreement with the board that Mark Emmert will be stepping down as president of the NCAA.  He will continue to serve in his role until a new president is selected and in place or until June 30, 2023.   \"Throughout my tenure I've emphasized the need to focus on the experience and priorities of student-athletes,\" said Emmert.  \"I am extremely proud of the work of the Association over the last 12 years and especially pleased with the hard work and dedication of the national office staff here in Indianapolis.\" \"With the significant transitions underway within college sports, the timing of this decision provides the Association with consistent leadership during the coming months plus the opportunity to consider what will be the future role of the president,\" said DeGioia. \"It also allows for the selection and recruitment of the next president without disruption.\" NCAA member schools adopted a new constitution in January and are in the process of transforming the structure and mission to meet future needs. 08.07.23 08.03.23 08.03.23 08.02.23 08.02.23 Thanks for visiting !

ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert. Washington State's Kirk Schultz, Baylor's Linda Livingstone and Clemson's Jim Clements are a few of more prominent presidents in the athletics realm.", "Forget NCAA president, given his accomplishments and background, Gavitt -- at age 55 -- could be the president. That's speaks to his talent level and popularity. 2. Val Ackerman, Big East commissioner: An icon in women's athletics, a leader in the reconstituted Big East, a lawyer. Ackerman checks a lot of the boxes. The first president of the WNBA (1996-2005) is the visionary the NCAA needs. When COVID-19 hit the Big East, the conference was fully insured against loss thanks to her leadership. Like all these candidates, she is qualified. It's a question of whether Ackerman has the desire to take the NCAA's heavy lift. 3. Linda Livingstone, Baylor president: Another Big 12 commissioner candidate, Livingstone is a member of the NCAA Transformation Committee responsible taking Gates' work and reshaping the NCAA. The former Oklahoma State basketball player oversees a private university with a powerful athletic department that chases championships the right way following the sexual assault scandal. We know Livingstone is engaged. She is simultaneously on the NCAA Board of Directors and Board of Governors. Either way, she is going to influence association policy. 4.

Rice told that story a couple of years ago during a book tour.", "Charlie Baker assumed the duties as the NCAA's sixth president on March 1, 2023.  He was hired for the position on Dec. 15, 2022, as he neared the conclusion of his term as the 72nd governor of Massachusetts. A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public sectors. Baker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the country is a top and immediate priority. A Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation.

That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.  First, history would suggest the NCAA has to lean away from hiring a school president as its next leader.  Dick Schultz (1988-93), the former Virginia president, was run out in scandal.", "The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn’t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA’s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association’s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, “Because it’s worth doing. Yeah, it’s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.“ Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn’t have a background in college athletics or higher education."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Avatar: The Way of Water pulled in $134 million at the domestic box office over the weekend, and another $301 million internationally, for a global total of $435 million, according to Variety.   By comparison, the first Avatar movie made around $77 million domestically over its first weekend in theaters back in December 2009, eventually bringing in a total of nearly $750 million domestically and over $2.7 billion worldwide.   Per Variety, Avatar 2 had the fourth-biggest opening weekend of the year. Earlier tracking previously estimated the film would earn $150 million to $175 million domestically and $450 million to $550 million globally, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

When asked about the budget for Avatar: The Way of Water, director James Cameron — whose budget for the first film was $237 million — told GQ last month that the sequel was \"very f---ing\" expensive to make.", "“Expectations aside, this is outstanding,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The movie is set up for a very strong run through the holidays.”  \tAs the sequel to the highest-grossing movie in history, Hollywood has some pretty high expectations for “The Way of Water,” which is Cameron’s first film to clear $100 million in a single weekend. The first “Avatar” opened in 2009 with $77 million domestically: a decent start but hardly one for the record books. But the film enjoyed unparalleled staying power, holding the No. 1 spot for seven weeks in a row and continuing to draw audiences for months. Thanks to pricey 3D tickets and repeat viewings, ticket sales eventually climbed to $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion globally.  \t“The Way of Water” will struggle to reach that benchmark, given the restrictions facing the COVID-battered box office. It won’t be playing in Russia, where the original film grossed $116 million. Though it is screening in China, the country’s box office has been struggling to rebound. Inaugural ticket sales in the country were below expectations at $57.1 million. In pandemic times, only three movies have crossed $1 billion worldwide and none have managed to hit $2 billion (though “Spider-Man: No Way Home” came close with $1.9 billion).", "“Avatar: The Way of Water” didn’t make quite as big of a splash as many assumed it would, but James Cameron’s big budget spectacle still helped breathe life into the box office this weekend. The sequel earned $134 million from North American theaters and $300.5 million internationally for a $434.5 million global debut, according to studio estimates on Sunday. It tied with “The Batman” as the fourth highest domestic debut of the year, behind “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ($187.4 million in May), “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” ($181 million in November), and “Thor: Love and Thunder” ($144.2 million in July). Expectations were enormous for “Avatar 2,” which carried a reported price tag of over $350 million, the pressure of following up the highest grossing film of all time (thanks in part to various re-releases) over a decade later and the daunting task of propping up an exhibition business that’s still far from normal. Everything “Avatar” is oversized, though: the Na’vi characters, the runtime (a staggering three hours and 12 minutes), the technical advancements and the release strategy from 20th Century Studios and The Walt Disney Co. The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on Thursday evening.", "Some even said $175 or higher, but tracking has also not been as reliable a metric during the pandemic.  Disney saw early that “The Way of Water” was going to be a different kind of beast when they looked at pre-sales. For a normal, spoiler-heavy movie like many Marvel offerings, post-opening weekend sales are usually around 5%. For “The Way of Water,” they were at 20%. In other words, the company knew that tracking was overinflated. “We’ve got a terrific movie that is playing across all demographics and (has) terrific word of mouth,” said Tony Chambers, the Walt Disney Co.’s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. “We’ve got the screens and we’ve got a clear run. This isn’t about the opening day or the opening weekend. This is about the entire run.” The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on Thursday evening. Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400 of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D format and premium large screens.  By the end of Friday, “Avatar: The Way of Water” had already earned $53 million in the U.S. and Canada and $180.", "IMAX and premium large format (PLF) made up nearly one third of the highly produced movie’s ticket sales on Thursday and Friday, Deadline reported. Avatar: The Way of Water, which has been years in production, received two Golden Globes nominations earlier this week, for best drama film and best director. Reviews have generally been positive, with viewers giving it a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while critics on the site give it a 78%. It also has a 69/100 review from critics and a 71/100 general review on Metacritic, and posted a score of 8.2/10 on IMDb. Earlier this week, the Hollywood Reporter called the sequel “monumental,” and said it “justifies its three-hours-plus of screen time and its mammoth financial investment,” although Variety was less favorable in its review, criticizing the movie for having “almost zero dimensionality to the characters,” while The Guardian dubbed it a “trillion-dollar screensaver.” $400 million. That’s how much Avatar: The Way of Water reportedly cost to produce. Cameron told GQ last month it needs to be the “third or fourth highest grossing film in history” in order to break even. The first Avatar movie grossed over $2.", "The true measure of box office success for James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water was always going to come down to how well the film would hold as it entered its second and third weekends in the market. After opening with the #37 highest-earning debut frame of all-time in the domestic market, the sequel held on with the #30 sophomore frame, and has just finished the New Year’s corridor with the fourth-highest tally for a film in its third weekend.  Last weekend, 20th Century Studios’ sci-fi sequel Avatar: The Way of Water dropped -53% in its sophomore frame to $63.3M. That more than doubled the combined debuts of its three new Christmas weekend competitors, all of which fell below expectations. Now in its third frame, the film increases <1% to $63.4M, easily holding onto third place.

Top overseas totals to date include: So far, the film has earned 69.", "Lucky for “The Way of Water” (though maybe not so lucky for theater owners), there’s not much competition through the rest of the year. However, its daunting 192-minute runtime could intimidate people from wanting to watch the movie again and again.  \tTurnout for “Avatar 2” was especially strong on Imax and 3D screens, with 62% of ticket sales coming from premium formats. Globally, the film made $48.8 million from Imax alone, registering as the company’s second-biggest weekend ever and highest December opening in history.  \t“As excited as we are about these early results, we anticipate a long and successful run for ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ as more people around the world book their ticket to Pandora for the epic storytelling and unmissable visual splendor of what James Cameron and his team have created,” says Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax.  \tGiven the hype around Cameron’s grand return to Pandora, rival studios opted to lay low so holdover titles rounded out the rest of box office charts. Another Disney blockbuster sequel, Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” slid to second place after five weeks at the No. 1 spot. The superhero epic added $5.3 million from 3,380 theaters, bringing its domestic tally to $418 million.

'Avatar: The Way of Water' made $53 million in its opening day release. The Disney and 20th Century Studios sequel to 2009’s Avatar—the highest-grossing film of all time—opened in more than 4,200 theaters this weekend, collecting $17 million in Thursday previews and another $36 million on Friday, Variety reported—nearly double the $26.7 million the first Avatar made on its opening day. Deadline projects it to make between $130 million and $150 million domestically this weekend, short of the $150 million to $170 million it had been projected to make. It falls short of the initial success of four Marvel and DC Comics sequels released earlier this year: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which made $90.7 on its opening day, as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($84.2 million), Thor: Love and Thunder ($69.5 million) and The Batman (56.6 million).

Discovery inherited by CEO David Zaslav.", "The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is given each year for animated films. An animated feature is defined by the Academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.[1][2][3]  The entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award's inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.[4]  For much of the Academy Awards' history, AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features, considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration.[5] Instead, the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions, usually for Walt Disney Pictures, such as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1938,[6] and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action/animated hybrid Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1989[7] and Toy Story in 1996.", "WATCH LIVE The voice cast includes Ewan McGregor, Christoph Waltz, fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton.

The director's stop-motion, musical take on the puppet who longs to be a real boy won Netflix its first animated feature trophy on Sunday. The category has primarily gone to either a Walt Disney or Pixar-produced film for the past decade - with the exception of \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\" \"Animation is ready to be taken to the next step. We are all ready for it. Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" Del Toro said. \"Pinocchio\" was considered the contender to beat. It swept several awards including the Golden Globe and the top honor at the animation industry's Annie Awards. The voice cast includes Ewan McGregor, Christoph Waltz, fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. It earned rave reviews for a stunningly beautiful production that takes a dark look at issues of love and mortality between the titular puppet and surrogate father, Gepetto. A polar opposite of Disney's 1940 version, this \"Pinocchio\" references Catholicism, fascism and the ugliness of war.", "However, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4]  From 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[23]  In 2010, the Academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as A Christmas Carol (2009) and The Adventures of Tintin (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future. This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, James stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as Bailey put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.", "8] In fact, prior to the award's creation, only one animated film was nominated for Best Picture: 1991's Beauty and the Beast, also by Disney.[9][10]  By 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider.[11] The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards,[12] held on March 24, 2002.[13] The Academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters.[14] It dropped the rule on April 23, 2019, to make voting for animated films more acceptable.[15] People in the animation industry, as well as fans, expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features.  In 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, Up was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by Toy Story 3.", "The stop-motion “Pinocchio” from Netflix took the Best Feature prize, as well as feature film awards for Best Character Animation (Tucker Barrie), Best Direction (del Toro and Mark Gustafson), Best Music (Alexandre Desplat, Roeban Katz, del Toro, Patrick McHale), and Best Production Design (Curt Enderle, Guy Davis).                     \t\t\t\t \t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\t\t\t                2024 Oscars: Best Visual Effects Predictions                  2024 Oscars: Best Supporting Actor Predictions           However, in winning Best Indie Feature at the Annies, A24’s “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On” stepped up as the primary challenger. The acclaimed stop-motion/live-action hybrid also scored Annies for Best Voice Acting for co-creator Jenny Slate and Best Writing — Feature (director Dean Fleischer Camp, Slate, Nick Paley, Elisabeth Holm). Although it was a critical favorite and is very well liked, the challenge has been getting it seen by more voters. The other three Oscar nominees are Pixar’s “Turning Red,” DreamWorks’ “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” and Netflix’s “The Sea Beast.” “Pinocchio,” del Toro’s first animated feature, has been the frontrunner from the outset, benefiting from the director’s auteur status.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

But sometimes the gravity of the Earth can also capture small asteroids, which then remain for a certain period of time, orbiting us as a kind of temporary moon. This has happened at least twice this century: “mini-moons” have remained in Earth’s orbit for several years or even less. But the newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG has probably been trapped in gravity for several decades. An interesting space rock was first observed on December 15, 2022. Interestingly, one of the first to notice it was amateur astronomer Henadii Borisov from Crimea, also known for the discovery of the first known interstellar comet, which now bears his name.  Asteroid 2022 YG, as it is originally catalogued, has a diameter of 16-30 meters. Early computer models of its orbit showed that it completed a total orbit of the Earth in one year. Moreover, this has been happening since about 1961. The simulation showed that the quasi-moon will continue to orbit the Earth until 2181, when it can finally free itself from the gravity of the Earth. Visualization of the orbital data for the year 2022 YG also shows that it takes a strange path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then migrating back to a rounder orbit and stretching again in the other direction before the whole cycle repeats.", "This discovery would be a “very exciting result,” she said, although further observations will be needed to confirm the moon’s existence. Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer from Queen’s University Belfast who was also not involved in the paper, says the moons are most likely chunks of Elektra that were broken off in a collision when another object smashed into the asteroid in the past. “They all look like they’re from the same material,” he said. Further study of this system could reveal the stability of such multi-moon asteroids. This third moon’s orbit is misaligned to the other two, something that’s “very strange,” Dr. Berdeu said. Dr. Yang said that she thought the system was unstable and that “the inner moons may eventually fall back” onto Elektra. It could also tell us more about the formation of multi-moon asteroids. “This new finding will inspire modelers to look at asteroid impact formation, and try to set a limit on how many moons an impact can form,” Dr. Yang said. “How many moons can a system really sustain?” Further studies are expected to unearth more quadruple systems too. New telescopes, such as the Extremely Large Telescope currently being built in Chile, will have the observing power necessary to more easily spot these multi-moon asteroid systems. And astronomers may not stop at quadruple asteroids. “There is no limit to what we can find,” Dr. Berdeu said.", "The space rock looks to have been captured by our planet's gravity over 60 years ago.    An asteroid just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades.  Our planet has a pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.  The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name.  Asteroid 2022 YG, as it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter. Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961. Run the simulation into the future, and it looks as though the asteroid will continue to act as a quasi-satellite until 2181 when it may finally break free from Earth's gravitational hold.", "He said it was “fascinating that we can pull additional observations of known objects or entirely new objects out of surveys and datasets.” At UW, Eli was also the president of the Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group, studying at Manastash Ridge Observatory in Ellensburg, Washington.

We scored enough in the first and held on. I couldn’t be prouder of this group. They keep finding a way.” Blake Pietila was named tournament MVP after stopping 31 shots in the title game and 24 in the semifinal win over the host Arizona State. “It feels good after coming off the GLI and our rough showing in the first game,” Blake Pietila said. “We knew that we had to stick to our game plan tonight. They’re a fast-transitioning team, so we had to stick to our (defensive) zone coverage like we’ve done all year.” Tech scored all of its goals in the opening period.

This ambitious \"Star Wars\"-inspired epic should land on the Netflix streaming platform by 2024. The universe abhors a vacuum and so it is in Hollywood, where the current absence of mega-budget space operas like \"The Expanse\" and \"Dune\" has given rise to \"Rebel Moon,\" a fantastic new sci-fi project from director Zack Snyder (\"Watchmen,\" \"Man of Steel,\" \"Justice League\"), and we've got a first peek at some breathtaking concept art shared via Twitter. As revealed on Variety on Feb. 9, \"Rebel Moon\" is sci-fi saga being created for Netflix that has a definite \"Seven Samurai,\" Akira Kurosawa vibe to it and actually began life as a grand pitch for a \"Star Wars\"-based feature nearly a decade ago prior to Disney swallowing up Lucasfilm in 2012.   Snyder co-wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad. The familiar-sounding plot centers around a mysterious young girl who must embark on a recruitment mission across the galaxy to locate mercenary soldiers that will aid a peaceful outpost against the military advances of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius.", "Editor's Note: This piece was updated on July 9. Rebel Moon will hit Netflix just in time for Christmas on December 22, 2023. This has become a trend for Netflix to release a buzzy title in the days leading up to Christmas. In the past, hit films such as Don't Look Up, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Bird Box, and 6 Underground were released on the service during the holiday season. Rebel Moon will have a limited theatrical release in the weeks before it lands on Netflix. As of right now, it is unknown when that'll be and how many theaters will screen the film. Snyder's previous film with Netflix, Army of the Dead, screened for one week in May 2021 across 600 theaters in the US. Rebel Moon will likely follow a similar route.  There is no trailer for Rebel Moon. That being said the first pieces of footage for the film were released in a sizzle reel for Netflix's 2023 film slate, which you can watch above. A behind-the-scenes featurette for Rebel Moon was unveiled during Netflix's Tudum event on June 17, 2023, previewing the film's massive scope and several of the cast-members reactions to working with Snyder on the film.", "Everything you need to know about Zack Snyder's new sci-fi movie franchise for Netflix. by Tigran Asatryan  Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale. Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten, who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder.  The Stone Quarry is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix.  Snyder commented on the inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.", "From whence shall our help come? Streaming powerhouse Netflix will be teaming up with Zack Snyder after the unprecedented success of his movie Army of the Dead.  After Zack’s lengthy run at Warner Bros and DC, he's found a new home with the streaming service promising an array of exciting new projects. His next film Rebel Moon has been touted to be an epic two-parter with the likelihood of spin-off properties. A lifelong Star Wars fan, Snyder initially intended Rebel Moon as a Star Wars movie. He had the idea to pitch Rebel Moon as a more mature take on the universe created by George Lucas. That idea was shut down after Walt Disney Co. acquired LucasFilm in 2012. Snyder then set up a deal with Deborah Snyder’s production company Stone Quarry and Netflix for Rebel Moon to be reworked into an entirely new universe. Rebel Moon represents a slight shift for Zack Snyder into a distinct sci-fi subgenre that is set in a peaceful colony on the border of a faraway galaxy. The one-time peaceful colony faces an existential threat from the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius. Residents of the colony in a bid to repel this great evil send out a young female dispatch rider named Kora who has a checkered past to solicit the help of different warriors from neighboring planets. Below are all the details regarding the cast, trailer, release date, plot, and everything we know so far for the upcoming sci-fi fantasy.", "A young woman is then sent out to assemble a team of warriors from neighboring planets who can help them fight back. Rebel Moon is clearly a big deal for Netflix, which is on the hunt for more homegrown franchises to line up alongside Stranger Things and The Witcher in the ongoing battle for streaming supremacy. Snyder himself told the Hollywood Reporter, \"my hope is that this also becomes a massive IP and a universe that can be built out.\" On top of the previously mentioned Rebel Moon sequel, Forbes say an RPG videogame may also be on the cards, while extended, R-rated versions of both confirmed Rebel Moon movies are seemingly on the way (via SlashFilm). Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it. Netflix isn't usually in the habit of showing off its wares half a year ahead of release, so it's still a little early for a full Rebel Moon trailer. Nonetheless, we have been treated to a tiny bit of footage courtesy of the streaming platform's 2023 preview.

Here’s everything else we know about Zack Snyder’s and Netflix’s Rebel Moon: The Hollywood Reporter has revealed the story synopsis for Netflix’s Rebel Moon: The story is set in motion when a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy is threatened by the armies of a tyrannical regent named Balisarius. Desperate, the colonists dispatch a young woman with a mysterious past to seek out warriors from neighboring planets to help them make a stand. As revealed, the movie is heavily inspired by Star Wars and used to be a Star Wars pitch a decade ago. Additional plot information for the movie was released in November 2021: “The film is set in a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy that finds itself threatened by the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius.

Here's everything you need to know about Zack Snyder's ode to Star Wars.  Rebel Moon is Netflix's big Christmas blockbuster and will land on the platform on December 22, 2023. That won't be the end of the story, however, because Netflix has decided to split Snyder's epic in two, meaning a sequel is definitely on the way. \"When we saw how big the world [Snyder] created was, we thought it would be better served as two pieces versus one film,\" Ori Marmur (one of the bosses of Netflix's original film group) told Variety. \"It's the kind of story that can continue to grow. He thinks of it as his take on making something like Star Wars.\" Watch Rebel Moon when it launches on Netflix:  Standard with ads (1080p): $6.99 / month Basic (720p): $9.99 / month Standard (1080p): $15.49 / month Premium (4K + HDR): $19.99 / month  Rebel Moon dates back to a bygone era of Star Wars, before George Lucas signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell the family business to Disney in 2012.", "Zack Snyder’s epic space fantasy Rebel Moon is coming to Netflix this year.

Front and center in the new featurette are star Sofia Boutella and director Snyder himself, who says that he has been dreaming up the Rebel Moon universe for more than two decades.  The details on the blockbuster are still hush-hush, but here’s what we know: A small peaceful colony on the outskirts of the galaxy is targeted by the insidious Imperium (embodied by a deliciously evil Skrein).

Billy Batson learns what it takes to become a hero in Shazam! Fury of The Gods, but does he have a future in the DC comic book universe? One of the credits scenes seems to hope so, but it’s extremely complicated. The first movie was about teen Billy (Asher Angel) unlocking the powers of Shazam — the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury — transforming him into a full-grown superhero (played by Zachary Levi). He learned to control that power, and share it with his siblings. Fury of the Gods is about the responsibility and duty of being a super-powered family that has to protect Philadelphia. Philadelphians are notoriously a tough crowd to win over, and that task is made even more difficult when a trio of super-powered goddesses (Helen Mirren, Lucy Liu, Rachel Zegler) threaten to destroy not only Philly but also all of planet Earth.  What does it mean to be powerful? Where’s the line between personal responsibility and the responsibility owed to people who can’t defend themselves? Why is Helen Mirren so mean in this movie? And why does she get body-slammed so many times?", "Yet the film version does appear to be the sibling Billy is closest to besides Freddy. Pedro Peña is Billy Batson's older foster brother. He is quiet and shy, has a hard time opening up, and does not say much at first. He appears to be trying to bulk up and get physically fit, as Darla hints \"he is trying to get swole.\" In his superpowered form, Pedro wears a green suit and appears to be a muscle-bound idea of what he wants to be and possesses a greater amount of super strength, giving him the strength of Hercules. While hinted at in the first film, the writers for the sequel have confirmed that Pedro is gay, which is made official within the second film, making him one of the most high-profile gay superheroes in a feature film. Jovan Armand plays the kid version of Pedro while D.J. Cotrona plays the adult version. In a fun bit of DC history, Cotrona was set to play Superman in a canceled Justice League movie by Mad Max: Fury Road director George Miller and would have been acting alongside fellow Shazam family member Adam Brody who was cast as The Flash. Darla Dudley is Billy Batson's younger foster sibling and the younger member of the Shazam Family. Darla is good-natured, sweet, and affectionate with her family and immediately tries to make Billy Batson feel welcomed and loved when he arrives.", "Between who's joining the cast and when it's slated to premiere, here's everything to know about the sequel to 2019's Shazam! starring Zachary Levi Skyler Caruso is the Editorial Assistant of PEOPLE Digital.  No magic word needed: a Shazam! sequel is already underway!   DC Comics' hit superhero movie is getting a reprisal with Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the highly-anticipated follow-up film that comes four years after its predecessor's theatrical release in April 2019.   Zachary Levi is making his return as the titular superhero character opposite Asher Angel, who is reprising his role as Shazam's teenage alter ego, Billy Batson. Familiar faces from the franchise are also set to appear in the film's second installment, plus several newcomers.   The news of Levi's return, specifically, came amid fan speculation that he would be cut from the franchise as the studio's newest CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran reconfigured the future of DC movies including Henry Cavill's departure as Superman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 3 being canceled.   In addition to concerns regarding the cast, backlash arose surrounding DC Studios' future storylines. Gunn posted a statement on Instagram reading, \"Disrespectful outcry will never, ever affect our actions\" regarding the company's upcoming movie slate — to which Levi commented, \"Amen. 🙏.\"", "26] In October 2020, the release date was once again shifted to June 2, 2023.

The Flash and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom were moved from 2022 to 2023 to allow time for their visual effects work to be completed, while Shazam! Fury of the Gods was moved up to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom's previous release date of December 16, 2022, because it would be ready for release earlier.[41] In April, the film's release date was pushed back five days to December 21 to avoid competition with Avatar: The Way of Water.[42] Rizwan Manji was revealed to be appearing as an unnamed character in July 2022.

Fury of the Gods was released at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, giving fans a closer look at what they can expect in the film's second installment — and for Levi's Shazam, that's a bit of imposter syndrome.   \"I'm an idiot,\" his superhero character says in the clip. \"I don't deserve these powers, if I'm being honest. Like, what am I even contributing?\" The goofy kid-inside-a-superhero, Billy Batson, goes on to compare himself to The Flash, Aquaman and Batman, the famed heroes of the DC extended universe.   \"And I'm just me,\" he continues. \"I feel like a fraud.\" The trailer gives a little recap of the 2019 Shazam! movie while also introducing the \"Daughters of Atlas,\" portrayed by Mirren, Liu and Zegler.   A second trailer was released in January, showcasing Mirren's villain Hespera and the Daughters of Atlas as they demand Billy and his friends give up their powers before the trio destroys the world.   In addition to Mirren, it also showcases newcomer Rachel Zegler and Billy's revamped team of super-powered teenagers as Shazam fights villains riding dragons and manages to sneak in a Game of Thrones reference or two.", "Related: Shazam!

The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.", "Before being reborn by saying the magic word \"Shazam,\" an acronym of the immortals Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury, this muscled do-gooder in spandex was just a kid named Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel.

Billy's foster bestie is Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen), Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) picked him as his successor. \"Put your hands on my staff,\" demanded the Wiz. \"Gross!\" said Billy, in a response that typified the script's \"Deadpool\"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that cheeky attitude still pops through in \"Shazam! Fury of the Gods\" as Billy/Shazam and his kid besties, now in adult superhero bodies -- Adam Brody for Freddy, Meagan Good for Darla, Ross Butler for Eugene,  D.J.

Over five hours of testimony, Chew repeatedly denied the app shares data or has connections with the Chinese Communist Party and argued the platform was doing everything to ensure safety for its 150 million American users. Chew said TikTok for more than two years has been \"building what amounts to a firewall to seal off protected U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access. The bottom line is this: American data stored on American soil, by an American company, overseen by American personnel,\" Chew said.

We collectively call this logic the ‘director,’ as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole,” Hartle said via email. “It’s worth mentioning that we don’t generate the artwork or the laugh track — those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.”  Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of ’90s point-and-click games that came out around the same time as Seinfeld. “We thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically relevant,” Hartle said over email.  This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn’t really compare to the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas.  One popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It’s titled, “Elaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.", "None of “Jerry’s” (who I believe they actually call Larry since nobody involved in this wants to be sued into the ground) stand-up bits are funny, which makes the silence and occasional miss-timed laugh track even funnier, but I did have a few moments of genuine laughter. There was a moment when “Jerry’s” talking about how the grocery story isn’t a great place to hear celebrity gossip. He said something like how it’s difficult to get juicy details while you’re picking up a carton of eggs. There’s a brief beat of silence before the laugh track kicks in, and I guffawed wondering if the AI put that laugh track there because it knows egg prices are absurd right now. There’s another bit where “Elaine” talks about how the city’s passing an ordinance against jaywalking and how she’ll never get anywhere in the city anymore. I don’t understand why, but I laughed along with the laugh track. AI programs are doing a lot these days, up to and including my very job. I’ve never seen an episode of Seinfeld, so I can’t vouch for whether or not an AI can faithfully reproduce what people tell me is one of the all-time great television shows. But the only thing that seems missing is that iconic funky baseline, which I imagine is hard to play if you have 37 fingers.", "The fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping, and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry.

The stream, hosted by a channel called watchmeforever, uses generative artificial intelligence to create an infinite stream of Seinfeld-esque content online. The novel idea has taken root on the platform, and at time of publication, the stream has roughly 15,400 concurrent viewers.  The content comes at a time when generative AI seems to be cropping up everywhere. Here’s what you need to know about AI Seinfeld on Twitch.  AI Seinfeld is a Twitch stream called “Nothing, Forever” that plays AI-generated content based on Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s ’90s comedic sitcom, Seinfeld. The show has been formally running since Dec. 14, but the group behind it, Mismatch Media, just started sharing in the past week. It sports a chunky 3D pixel style that looks a video game, and computerized voices that deliver an endless stream of Seinfeld-esque antics.  Skyler Hartle, a member of Mismatch Media, told Polygon that the stream uses various AI software to bring the show to life. The text generation comes from OpenAI’s GPT-3 models and the speech comes from Azure Cognitive Services.", "The result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI’s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.” After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn’t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying.", "The surreal Nothing, Forever, streaming 24 hours a day, is an eerie experiment in digital creativity Seinfeld went off the air in 1998, but it’s never really gone away – it’s been the subject of modern recreations, dedicated social media accounts and hip-hop/TV fusions. Its latest incarnation, however, is the oddest yet. Nothing, Forever is an endless, AI-generated version of the show that has been streaming on Twitch since mid-December. It tells the “story” – if you can call it that – of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from OpenAI’s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, “we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak,” Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. “We collectively call this logic the ‘director’, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

It will also be offered to current private school families who make at or below 300% of the federal poverty level.

The program is expected to cost $345 million annually by its fourth year, once it is fully phased in, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency.", "“The Senate made clear tonight that parents matter. Iowans want and deserve school choice and educational freedom for their children and I urge the House to get this across the finish line and send a bill to my desk,” Reynolds said.  In fiscal 2021, the state’s general fund ended with a $1.24 billion surplus. The $55.2 million amounts to roughly 4.4 percent of the general fund.   Our ruling Jennifer Konfrst stated that only 2 percent of K-12 students in Iowa would benefit from the Putting Students First Act that is moving through the Iowa Legislature. With about 485,000 school children in the state and only 10,000 vouchers available, she is correct.  We rate the statement True.  Sources  Press release from Iowa Rep.

Feb.", "Iowa's public schools are the foundation of our education system. For most families, they are the option of choice – and they should be. But public schools aren’t the only choice, and for some families, a different educational path may be better for their children.    Governor Reynolds believes Iowa’s investment in education should support the success of all students, including those whose families choose to enroll them in an accredited private school rather than a public school.     Students First Act signed into law  On January 24, 2023, Governor Reynolds signed the Students First Act into law, just two weeks after introducing it in her annual Condition of the State address. The bill makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools. It also provides public schools with additional categorical funding for students who live in their district but attend private schools, and allows public school districts to use unspent money from some categorical funds to supplement teacher salaries.  Education Savings Accounts  With the passage of the Students First Act, parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses.", "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under Iowa’s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds’ voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it’s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.", "Ron Robinson, Iowa’s Legislative Service Agency specialist on the bill, said that in order to apply for one of the vouchers, a student’s family must be 400 percent below poverty level, or have an Individualized Education Plan.  To pay for this, $55.2 million would be moved from Iowa’s general fund — the state’s main operating fund. Each student who uses a voucher would receive roughly $5,500, which is 70 percent of that state’s per pupil allocation, Robinson said. The bill passed the Iowa Senate 31-18 on March 30 and has moved to the House.  We cannot gauge whether “the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” because that is a prediction. But Robinson confirmed Konfrst’s statement that 2 percent of Iowa’s K-12 children will have a chance at vouchers. Only 10,000 vouchers would be available for about 485,000 school children in Iowa, he said.  However, other student funding generated from taxes and federal funds will remain in the district that the student leaves. According to the governor’s fact sheet, public schools will retain roughly $1,400 per pupil in property tax dollars for each student from that particular school district who uses a voucher to attend a private school. After the Senate vote, Gov. Kim Reynolds sent a news release that said the state should create opportunities for more families to provide their children with the education choice best for them.", "The Iowa Senate passed SF 2369, and Democratic Rep. Konfrst said in a press release that the bill would harm more Iowa K-12 students than it helps. When looking at the number of vouchers available and the cost to provide them, she is technically right.   Lauren White, Politics Reporter April 7, 2022 PolitiFact Iowa is a project of The Daily Iowan’s Ethics & Politics Initiative and PolitiFact to help you find the truth in politics. If your time is short Back in January, the opening of the Iowa legislative session was full of discussion about letting parents choose their children’s education. Since then, lawmakers took another step toward that goal when the Iowa Senate passed a school voucher bill known as SF 2369, the Putting Students First Act. Prior to passing the bill, House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, sent a press release condemning the legislation. She said the voucher bill would hurt more students than it helps.  “If the bill is approved, only 2% of Iowa students would benefit while the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” Konfrst said in the press release.  SF 2369 would create 10,000 vouchers to use for parents in the area to transfer their kids from their local public school to a private school of their choice.", "Since the law was signed, some private schools have raised their tuition and Holy Family Catholic Schools in Dubuque reported an increase in applications since Governor Reynolds signed the school voucher law. There is no limit on the number of students who can enroll for an ESA but there are limits in the first two years on who can enroll for an ESA. Any student not previously enrolled in a private school is eligible for an ESA for enrolling in a private school. For students already enrolled in a private school, families earning less than 3 times the poverty level, which equals $83,250 for a family of 4, would also be eligible. That increases to 4 times the poverty level for the 2024-25 school year and removes any restrictions on eligibility after that school year. Copyright 2023 KCRG. All rights reserved.", "Wills said the bill is meant for families who may want a faith-based education for their children or an academic program not offered at their local schools. He added that the legislation is also Republicans’ response to conservative parents who, in recent years, have claimed that public schools advance a liberal agenda in the way they teach race and history or by holding books in the library some parents find obscene. Gov. Kim Reynolds held a closed meeting last spring with parents from Linn-Mar schools who were upset with a policy that allows students in seventh grade and older to keep their gender support plans private. Wills said that policy is one justification for a vast expansion of state funding for private schools in Iowa. “Why would a parent want to want to choose an Educational Savings Account? Well, maybe they don't trust the public schools anymore,” Wills said. “This is a school refusing to tell parents about their children. Maybe that's why parents choose to go someplace other than public school.” Under the school choice bill, starting next fall, families would be able to apply for Education Savings Accounts, or ESAs, worth $7,598 that they could use to pay for educational expenses such as private school tuition. A fiscal analysis prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimates that, in the first year of the program, 14,068 children would receive Education Savings Accounts, including 4,841 transferring from public to private schools. The program would cost $106.", "The Students First Act, introduced by Governor Reynolds and signed into law on Jan. 24, 2023, makes state funding available to support the success of every K-12 student in Iowa. The bill establishes a framework and funding for education savings accounts (ESAs), which may be used by eligible families to cover tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses at accredited nonpublic schools in Iowa. The State Board of Education adopted administrative rules on May 4, 2023, that specify definitions for the program, eligibility requirements for participation, parameters for the application process, and program administration and accountability.

A chatbot can instantly produce answers in complete sentences that don’t force people to scroll through a list of results, which is what a search engine would offer. Google started Bard as a webpage on its own rather than a component of its search engine, beginning a tricky dance of adopting new A.I. while preserving one of the tech industry’s most profitable businesses. “It’s important that Google start to play in this space because this is where the world is headed,” said Adrian Aoun, a former Google director of special projects. But the move to chatbots could help upend a business model reliant on advertising, said Mr. Aoun, who is now the chief executive of the health care start-up Forward. In late November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, an online chatbot that can answer questions, write term papers and riff on almost any topic. Two months later, the company’s primary investor and partner, Microsoft, added a similar chatbot to its Bing internet search engine, showing how the technology could shift the market that Google has dominated for more than 20 years. Google has been racing to ship A.I. products since December. It declared a “code red” in response to ChatGPT’s release, making A.I. the company’s central priority.", "From imagining the prime minister leading a cabinet meeting about war to a guide on how best to start your own podcast, Google's LaMDA AI is certainly flexible.

A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI.

For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology.

{"id": 249, "query": "who founded midjourney?", "ans": ["David Holz"], "label": [1], "prediction": "David Holz founded Midjourney.", "docs": ["“We’re going from a Midjourney universe to a Midjourney multiverse,” as Holz puts it. And he thinks the results will be incredible: an outpouring of AI-augmented creativity that’s still only the tip of the iceberg.  To find out more about Holz’s ambitions with Midjourney — about why he’s building an “engine for the imagination” and why he thinks AI is more like water than a tiger — we rang him up for an interview. And, of course, we got Midjourney to illustrate our conversation.  This interview below has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  It’d be great to start with a bit about yourself and Midjourney. What’s your background? How did you get in this scene? And what is Midjourney — a company, a community? How would you describe it? So, my name is David Holz, and I guess I’m a serial entrepreneur. My brief history would be: I had a design business in high school. I went to college for physics in maths. I was working on a PhD in fluid mechanics while working at NASA and Max Planck. I got overwhelmed at one point and put all those things aside. So I moved to San Francisco and started a technology company called Leap Motion around 2011. And we sold these hardware devices that would do motion capture on your hands, kind of inventing a lot of the gestural interface space.", "\"They're using it as an emotional and intellectual reflective tool,\" he said. \"And that's really cool.\" Holz dislikes the idea of using Midjourney to create fake photographs. \"Using it editorially to create fake photos is extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"No one should do that.\" But he's more open to Midjourney as a source of commercial illustration, noting that The Economist ran a Midjourney graphic on its cover in June. \"We only recently allowed people to use it commercially,\" said Holz. \"For a long time, it was non-commercial only. And so one of the things we're doing is we're just watching it, what people are doing, and we might decide that we're not comfortable with some of that and then we're going to put in a rule saying you can no longer use it just for those things.\" Holz said he sees AI tools like Midjourney making artists better at what they do rather than making everyone a professional artist. \"An artist using these tools is always better than a regular person using these tools. At some point, might there be pressure to use these tools because you can make things that are so great? I think yes. But right now, I don't think it's quite there yet. But it will get shockingly better over the next two years.", "Rob Salkowitz, Forbes Contributor: What’s your role and title? David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is Midjourney’s mission?  We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that it’s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this text-to-image technology for business and society? I’m definitely more concerned about society than business. We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not. Artists on the platform tell us it allows them to be more creative and explorative in the beginning, coming up with a lot of ideas in a short amount of time. Right now, our professional users are using the platform for concepting.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me.", "So far though, Holz said there hadn't been any complaints, what's more, some famous artists who use the platform say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.” But if the problem does arise, Holz said the team is open to it, although they don’t have a process for that yet. Speaking of art style, Midjourney has some distinguishing features no other tool like this has. It's \"artistic\" in a way that the generated images look like paintings and never like photos. \"We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.\" Midjourney's style is \"whimsical and abstract and weird.\" Holz shared that it has favorite colors (it uses a lot of blues and oranges) and faces. The developers don’t know why it happens, \"but there’s a particular woman’s face it likes to draw\" – people call it “Miss Journey.", "As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.", "The hardest part of [a commercial art project] is often at the beginning, when the stakeholder doesn’t know what they want and has to see some ideas to react to. Midjourney can help people converge on the idea they want much more quickly, because iterating on those concepts is very laborious. Another advantage for artists is it gives people confidence in areas they’re not confident in. Most if not all artists feel like there’s some part of art they can’t do well. It might be colors, composition, backgrounds. We have a famous character designer using our product and people ask him why would you use an AI since you’re so good already. And he said, “well, I’m only good at the character part. This is helping me build out the rest of the world.” About how many people are using the product? Millions are using it. Our Discord is over two million. It’s the biggest active Discord server by far now. Does Midjourney’s license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by the platform? Yes. But if you’re working for a company bigger than a million dollars in annual revenue, we ask that you buy a corporate license. How was the dataset built? It’s just a big scrape of the Internet. We use the open data sets that are published and train across those. And I’d say that’s something that 100% of people do. We weren’t picky.", "Founded by David Holz, co-founder of Leap Motion, Midjourney is a creative tool that can be used in various fields to create unique and captivating images with a bright future ahead of it Menu Contact  Immersion Rue de l’Enseignement 50 1000 Bruxelles Horaire* Lundi: 13:00 – 22:00 Mardi: 13:00 – 22:00 Mercredi: 13:00 – 22:00 Jeudi: 13:00 – 22:00 Vendredi: 16:00 – 22:00 Samedi: 13:00 – 22:00 Dimanche: 13:00 – 20:00 * Teambuilding ou Evénements sont possibles en dehors des heures d’ouverture A propos Centre de Réalité Virtuelle situé à proximité du Cirque Royal.  Plongez-vous dans une nouvelle ère d’Escape Games exclusivement disponibles chez Immersion.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people.

We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord.

Other tech rivals such as Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have been researching similar technology, but Microsoft’s latest moves aim to position it at the center of the ChatGPT zeitgeist.  Microsoft disclosed in January that it was pouring billions more dollars into OpenAI as it looks to fuse the technology behind ChatGPT, the image-generator DALL-E and other OpenAI innovations into an array of Microsoft products tied to its cloud computing platform and its Office suite of workplace products like email and spreadsheets. The most surprising might be the integration with Bing, which is the second-place search engine in many markets but has never come close to challenging Google’s dominant position. Bing launched in 2009 as a rebranding of Microsoft’s earlier search engines and was run for a time by Nadella, years before he took over as CEO.

And we are able to have our AI act upon billions of interactions from pinners that make these product associations, which is very different than what you'd find on any other social media platform or really any other shopping platform.\" These efforts around AI, coupled with fresh cost cuts, are expected to drive margin expansion this year for Pinterest in the face of an ad sales market that Ready says is still \"choppy.\" Pinterest sees first-quarter sales growing by a low-single-digit percentage year over year. Expenses are forecast to drop by low double digits. Pinterest stock is up more than 20% year-to-date, outpacing the performance of the Nasdaq Composite, as Wall Street waits for accelerated user growth. \"Overall, we remain neutral-rated while we watch for the new CEO’s impact on MAUs and the overall user experience, along w/ improved monetization, while driving cost efficiencies, all into an uncertain macro environment,\" JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote.

See Press Release Here.  Ben sent an email to employees at Pinterest, which we are sharing below: From: Ben Date: Tuesday, June 28, 2022 Title: Help me welcome our new CEO, Bill Ready Dear Team,  After more than a decade running Pinterest, I’ve decided to move into a new role, Executive Chairman. While it feels a bit weird typing these words, more than anything, I’m excited because tomorrow our new CEO will be Bill Ready. I want to share how I came to this decision.    One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine.  I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out. Over months of conversations and dinners, he impressed me with his insights, experience and values. Bill understands deep down that Pinterest is still early in its story. Over time, I decided he would be an outstanding CEO for our next chapter. Our board of directors met him and felt the same way.", "Silbermann continued, “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see. Bill is a great leader for this transition. He is a builder who deeply understands commerce and payments. And he shares our passion for creating a positive corner of the Internet. I’m confident he’s going to be an outstanding CEO.”   “On behalf of the Board, I am thrilled to welcome Bill to the Pinterest team,” said Andrea Wishom, Pinterest Board Lead Independent Director. “Bill is a proven leader, whose experience in payments, product development, and shopping uniquely positions him to take Pinterest to its next phase of growth. It is a testament to the remarkable vision and leadership of Ben that we are able to welcome Bill, who shares similar values. The Board and I look forward to working with them both to accelerate Pinterest's strategy of bringing everyone the inspiration to create the life they love.”   “There’s no better time to join Pinterest,” said Ready. \"I have long admired the brand and platform that Ben and the Pinterest team have created and everything the Company stands for. I am excited to build on that foundation to further scale the Company’s ecosystem and drive increased value for shareholders. Having built multiple businesses from zero and operated at the scale of billions of users, I have a deep appreciation for what it takes to scale a business like this to the next level.", "\"In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see. Bill is a great leader for this transition. He is a builder who deeply understands commerce and payments,\" Silbermann said in a statement. Silbermann, who co-founded the company in 2010 and took it public in April 2019, will serve as the company's first Executive Chairman. Silbermann faced challenges ranging from missed quarterly user expectations to a series of workforce complaints, including two Black former Pinterest employees whose public claims of discrimination and retaliation became the basis of a California workforce non-disclosure law. \"As someone who has spent most of my career in commerce and payments, it's so clear to me that Pinterest has the opportunity to build something unique—something special,\" Ready said in a LinkedIn post. Shares of Pinterest are down 45.8% year to date and are nearly 76% off of 52-week highs. Ready had been tasked with leading Google’s most recent efforts to compete in e-commerce against the likes of Amazon, after prior failed attempts. Earlier this year, for example, Ready and his team launched a feature that lets people move from store listings on a Google search page to a merchant’s checkout site in a single click.", "Most recently, Bill was President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Before that, he was Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, and CEO of both Braintree and Venmo.  At his core, Bill is a builder. He has led small startups and global organizations. He deeply understands commerce and payments. And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet—a place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it.  As you can imagine, this was a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder’s love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways. That’s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm.  I’m not leaving. Being executive chairman will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days.  When we started Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our website to show there was a real person who cared about every user. Thank goodness for unlimited minutes!", "Ready takes over the company at an interesting time, as the company has pushed hard to lead in creating a better kind of social network while also dealing with internal accusations about a problematic and discriminatory work culture. The rest of the internet is also catching up to Pinterest, as platforms like Snap and YouTube and even Twitter are embracing the shopping-ification of everything. Pinterest had an opportunity to be a major player in digital commerce and maybe still does.

And we’re glad, because the Pikmin series is full of wit, charm, and originality. During the September 2022 Direct, Nintendo finally unveiled the next entry, aptly titled Pikmin 4. This announcement came nearly a decade after the previous entry, and although we don’t know much about it, we’re excited it’s happening. The latest installment of the oddball strategy series is bringing some new features, including a brand new Pikmin type and an adorable dog companion. Positioned as the Switch’s big summer 2023 release, it has the chance to get more eyes on the series than ever before. Here’s what you need to know about Pikmin 4. While fans were expecting the game to be Nintendo’s big holiday 2023 release, the sequel is actually coming a bit earlier than that. Pikmin 4 will launch on July 21, 2023, which will make it the first major Switch exclusive to launch in a post-Tears of the Kingdom world. Pikmin is a first-party Nintendo franchise, so don’t expect to play the new installment on PlayStation, Xbox, or any other platforms.", "After defeating him and the dog, the recruit recovers both him and some DNA from the dog's collar, providing the final ingredient for curing Oatchi. After discovering that Moss cannot be cured, Olimar determines that she was born on the planet and decides to leave her behind with the Pikmin. The Rescue Corps agree and depart with the others, while Olimar leaves with the Dolphin. Meanwhile, Moss goes exploring with the Pikmin, pursued eagerly by the Ancient Sirehound, which has now become tame.  On September 7, 2015, Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed to Eurogamer that Pikmin 4 was in development, and \"very close to completion\".[10][11] On July 7, 2016, Miyamoto said in an E3 interview with Game Rant that Pikmin 4 was still in development, though at a lower priority.[12] On June 19, 2017, Miyamoto reassured Eurogamer that the game was still \"progressing\".[13] In the years to follow, the game was widely considered vaporware[14][15] until it was officially unveiled on September 13, 2022.  Pikmin 4 was developed using Unreal Engine, its first use in an internally developed Nintendo EPD game.[16]", "However, the Japanese gaming company tends not to share that information for each individual release; although there is information on its support page regarding the time most first-party Switch games should release. According to the support page, \"Digital software that is also sold physically will usually be available at 9:00 p.m. PT the night before the physical game's release date.\" This gives us the confirmation that Pikmin 4 will more than likely be available to start playing the night before launch, at least in the United States. Fans on the west coast will be able to jump in at 9 PM PT on Thursday night, and those on the east coast (NYC) should be able to play it around midnight.

The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn’t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

Outside of the new Pikmin types, Oatchi will be a major gameplay addition. Aside from being able to fight for you, he will have new abilities you can unlock and upgrade, such as riding him in water and having him break through obstacles in the world. Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night — a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It’ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo’s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once.

Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this guide comes into play.

This installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles.

The company said it expected to shed a total of 10,000 jobs over the course of three rounds. It’s unclear exactly how many workers are impacted by the latest round, but the layoffs, once again, seem to be primarily in non-engineering roles. People in marketing, communications, and recruiting have lost their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited posts on LinkedIn. Meta will also be slashing nearly 500 jobs from its Irish office, about 20 percent of its workforce in the country, according to a separate report. Meta declined to comment on the cuts. A spokesperson pointed to a memo Mark Zuckerberg shared with employees last fall when the company conducted an earlier round of 11,000 layoffs. In the message, he said that economic conditions had “caused our revenue to be much lower” than expected. He described  the job cuts as “some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history” and “what we need going forward.” Zuckerberg has talked openly about the need for more “efficiency” in the months since.

Mr. Zuckerberg said that budgets would be reduced, including some employee perks, and that the company would cut back on real estate. A hiring freeze was extended until March. On Wednesday, laid-off employees immediately lost access to most corporate systems, though their email accounts will remain active until the end of the day “so everyone can say farewell,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “This will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate,” he said. The company will focus on a smaller number of “high priority” areas, he said, including artificial intelligence, advertising and the metaverse. Meta began notifying European-based employees of the cuts during their morning, with those retaining their jobs receiving emails just minutes after those who were laid off, three employees said. As the Silicon Valley headquarters began waking up Wednesday, employees described tense hours as people stared at their inboxes awaiting news. For those who lost their job in the United States, Meta said it would pay severance of 16 weeks of their base pay, along with two additional weeks for every year they worked at the company.

These cuts come just four months after he laid off 11,000 employees, or 13 percent of the company, last November. The first wave of layoffs will start this week and impact Meta’s recruiting organization, followed by a second wave for tech roles in April and a third focused on business roles in late May. “My hope is to make these org changes as soon as possible in the year so we can get past this period of uncertainty and focus on the critical work ahead,” Zuckerberg wrote in a memo to employees that was also posted on his Facebook page. He called the collapse in Meta’s revenue growth last year a “humbling wake-up call” and told employees that “we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.” “Higher interest rates lead to the economy running leaner, more geopolitical instability leads to more volatility, and increased regulation leads to slower growth and increased costs of innovation,” he wrote. “Given this outlook, we’ll need to operate more efficiently than our previous headcount reduction to ensure success.”  In a separate filing with the SEC, Meta said the new cuts will lower the high end of its expense guidance for the year by $3 billion.", "CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed the cuts to overhiring during the pandemic.

We're joined now by Wall Street Journal technology reporter Sam Schechner. Sam, thanks for coming on.SAM SCHECHNER: A pleasure to be here.PFEIFFER: These are a lot of layoffs, but I want to make sure we put it in the overall context of how large Meta is. So tell us, how many employees does it have now? How many will it have left once the layoffs are done?SCHECHNER: Well, those are good questions. We know the numerator. We don't necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the company said."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}
{"id": 254, "query": "What company acquired iRobot?", "ans": ["Amazon"], "label": [1], "prediction": "iRobot was acquired by Amazon.", "docs": ["Landmark antitrust legislation targeting Amazon and other Big Tech companies has languished for months in Congress as prospects for votes by the full Senate or House have dimmed. Last month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who heads the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel, urged the the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the One Medical acquisition, in the mold of other critics who've called on regulators to block the purchase over concerns about Amazon's past conduct and potential implications for consumers' health data. Regulators also have discretion to challenge Amazon's $8.5 billion buyout of Hollywood studio MGM, which was completed earlier this year. Founded in 1990 by a trio of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticists, including Angle, iRobot's early ventures led to rovers that could perform military and disaster-relief tasks in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. The profits from defense contracts allowed iRobot to experiment with a variety of other robots, producing some duds and one huge commercial success: the first Roomba, introduced in 2002, which pioneered the market for automated vacuum cleaners. The company spun off its defense robotics division in 2016 to become almost exclusively a seller of vacuums and some other home robots, such as the Braava robotic mop. It planned to launch a robotic lawn mower in 2020 but backed off, citing problems tied to the pandemic.", "; Charlie Vaida, Media Relations, iRobot Corp., (781) 430-3182, cvaida@irobot.", "Amazon’s $1.7 billion deal to buy Bedford-based iRobot came together in less than three months this summer, and it culminated in the e-commerce giant reducing its offer. According to a document iRobot filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday, it also was the second time Amazon tried to buy the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner and other household robots. The new information reveals more background on how Amazon, which already has a large robotics presence in Massachusetts, scooped up one of the area’s oldest and most influential robotics firms. Amazon first tried to buy iRobot in the fall of 2016, the filing said, but iRobot’s board of directors determined the offer “undervalued” the company at $60.50 per share. In the coming months, iRobot’s stock price increased, and Amazon ended its acquisition discussions. Advertisement The next time Amazon expressed interest in buying iRobot was on May 16 of this year, when an Amazon representative called Colin Angle, cofounder and chief executive of the company. Amazon proposed acquiring iRobot for $64 per share in cash about a month later. Again, iRobot believed Amazon’s offer undervalued the company. On June 29, iRobot issued a counteroffer to Amazon, asking for $70 per share. On the same day, iRobot told Amazon that it anticipated a second-quarter earnings miss.

The Eagles are looking to win their second Super Bowl title following their victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII in 2018. The Chiefs reached the Super Bowl with a thrilling 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC championship game. Harrison Butker’s 45-yard field goal in the closing seconds sealed the win for the Chiefs on Jan. 29.

The Chiefs also practiced at Arizona State University in Tempe.[51]  The game was informally referred to as the \"Andy Reid Bowl\", as Chiefs head coach Andy Reid had previously served as the head coach of the Eagles from 1999 to 2012.[52][53] Reid became the fifth head coach to face his former team in the Super Bowl, joining Weeb Ewbank (Super Bowl III), Dan Reeves (XXXIII), Jon Gruden (XXXVII), and Pete Carroll (XLIX).[54]  The game was also referred to as the \"Kelce Bowl\",[55][56][57] as this marked the first Super Bowl to feature brothers playing against each other: Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles center Jason Kelce.[55][58]  The game was the first Super Bowl between two black starting quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs and Jalen Hurts of the Eagles.[59][60] Mahomes (27 years of age) and Hurts (24) were the youngest starting quarterback pair in Super Bowl history.[61]  Super Bowl LVII was televised by Fox and Fox Deportes.[62] It marked the final game to be broadcast under the current NFL television contract.", "The AFC Championship pitted the Chiefs against the Cincinnati Bengals in a rematch of the 2021 AFC Championship game. This was the fifth consecutive AFC Championship hosted by the Chiefs, extending their record. Much like the previous year's contest, the game was close toward the end of the fourth quarter. On the game's last drive, tied at 20, Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai was flagged for a late hit on Patrick Mahomes after he stepped out of bounds, which set the Chiefs up in field goal range with eight seconds remaining. Harrison Butker then kicked a 45-yard field goal to send the Chiefs to the Super Bowl with a 23–20 win.[46]  The Eagles went into the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Their first playoff matchup was against their NFC East rival New York Giants. The Eagles quickly jumped to a 28–0 halftime lead and cruised to the NFC Championship game with a 38–7 victory, which marked the first playoff win for Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and head coach Nick Sirianni. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles hosted the San Francisco 49ers.

The change was made following renewed scrutiny of playoff overtime rules after the Kansas City Chiefs’ AFC divisional playoff win over the Buffalo Bills in January 2022.

Recorded music revenue jumped 76.4% to 149.1 billion won ($118.2 million) and was the largest single source of revenue.   \tBTS’s global success has allowed HYBE to diversify itself and rely less on the K-pop super group.

The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.", "Does the audience have a clinical background or are they non-clinical? All of these factors matter when teaching a class.  Whether your learners are baby llamas or adult llamas, you can invest energy in examples and training types that are right for them. Everyone will get more out of the experience.  The llamas aren’t hiking all the time, every day. They don’t do tours in the off-season. So every year, they have to retrain to break down bad habits they’ve developed when they aren’t hanging out with humans every day. The trainers don’t expect llamas to learn it once and remember it forever. We shouldn’t expect that from humans either. Learning is continuous. While right after training, everyone may be very aware of what they are doing and very careful to do it correctly, as time passes we become more comfortable. We might forget what we’ve learned. New challenges may change what we do. That’s why we need to train continuously and retrain when something changes or a lot of time has passed. Everyone needs a refresher now and then to deliver a reliable experience.  They set up every llama for a great, successful hike.

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger.

Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Curtis’ win — against, among others, co-star Stephanie Hsu, with whom she was splitting votes — suggests a deep well of support for the film, which was already leading the Oscars field with 11 nominations.

It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff.

Presented by    Big plays were in short supply last year for the Hokies. Points, too. You don’t break offensive futility records from 30 or more years ago unless you’ve got issues, a reason Virginia Tech went so hard in the transfer portal for skill guys this offseason. It was only the spring game Saturday, which comes with its usual caveats, but the Hokies appeared to have a deeper roster of play-makers show up in the Maroon team’s 34-0 blanking of the White team in Lane Stadium. Running backs Chance Black and Bryce Duke combined for 152 yards, with Black finding the end zone twice. Tucker Holloway’s three catches for 77 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown in the third quarter, paced a revamped receiver room that has more options. Overall, the Hokies had seven plays go for 20 or more yards Saturday, following up a dismal 2022 season when they averaged just 3.5 such plays per game, among the fewest in the country. “We needed that,” Hokies head coach Brent Pry said. “Everybody has those playmakers. Every good team has enough guys that can get you out of a jam and make a play. When the defense is where they’re supposed to be, they still come down with it and make something happen.", "Because of what Pry said was partially due to a shortage of experienced and healthy offensive linemen, the Maroon team beat the White team 34-0 in a two-hour exhibition (including the obligatory commercial breaks). “Our roster isn’t where it needs to be yet,” Pry said. “When you split it, you’ve got some weak spots that can show up. And that happened a little bit today. But I was pleased. We were efficient. … The kicking game was pretty clean. The operation was pretty clean.” At wide receiver, where some of the most significant changes were made roster-wise, the standouts on Saturday were a couple of returning Hokies — Stephen Gosnell and Tucker Holloway. Gosnell, who Pry called Virginia Tech’s most consistent receiver during the spring, caught three passes for 53 yards. Holloway, a sophomore who joined the Hokies as a true freshman late in 2022, had three catches for 77 yards, including a 39-yard TD reception from freshman Pop Watson and a 33-yard catch from 2022 starting quarterback Grant Wells on a fourth-and-4 play in the first quarter. “Yeah, he’s another guy that’s just developing in the program,” Pry said. “He’s doing a great job. I’m excited for Tuck. We have competition at the wide receiver position, which we didn’t have previously.", "Final Takeaway It's always a fun experience to see the Hokies in the Spring Game, but it's worth a mention to remind everyone that results on the field do not directly translate to next fall's success or failures. Despite a 34-0 scoreline - the format of the Spring Game can be beneficial to some players and detrimental to others. Ultimately, the glorified scrimmage is an opportunity to see the latest developments with key personnel, while also affording a chance for younger players to get their opportunity to play in front of the fans in Lane Stadium. Things will likely change a lot more before the next time we see the team play and it's best to acknowledge the developments on the field, while understanding that the offseason spectacle is purely entertainment.  © 2005-2023 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The spectacle filled Lane Stadium to half capacity and was televised by the ACC Network. It was the first chance for thousands of fans to watch the 2023 Virginia Tech Hokies in a simulated game atmosphere. The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday:  1. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.", "e-Pilot e-Pilot Evening Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Pilot e-Pilot Evening Edition  \t\t\tTop Picks:\t\t Matt Gentry/AP Virginia Tech quarterback Grant Wells rolls out while observed by head coach Brent Pry during the team's spring game Saturday in Blacksburg.

BLACKSBURG — Once last year’s football season came to an end, Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said the plan in his second year with the Hokies was to upgrade the talent level in the offensive skill positions. Saturday’s spring football game at Lane Stadium was the first time Virginia Tech’s fans got a good glimpse of where things are at in that category. And while some of those new faces may not have been in the spotlight, their impact was evident in what the Hokies were getting out of some of their returning wide receivers and running backs. There was progress, Pry said, although most of that was only seen on the Maroon side of the football.", "Filed under: It’s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game.  There were lots of things to look at and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game.  GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was easily over 20,000 people.  Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.   The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells starting at Maroon Squad QB.  He’d remain there for the first half.   We’ll talk about the various observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more comfortable than he was last season.  We’ll take that as a major plus, for now."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Mr. Cook said the stores are \"off to a great start.” Terming the opening of Apple’s first two stores in Mumbai and Delhi as a “milestone” for the company, the Apple CEO said, “...in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creators and team members I got to spend time with.\"  Also Read:‘I’m very bullish on India’: Apple CEO Tim Cook “I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months, so many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us, and that means a great deal to us,” he said. He said that Apple has been expanding its operations in India to serve more customers. “We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we're partnering with, and we're very happy with how that's going overall. Overall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there,” Mr.", "But most of these products are too high end for a country like India where a bulk of the market is not in the premium segment,\" says Prasanto K Roy, who has worked extensively on issues of technology and public policy.  Apple has long tried to open physical retail stores in India - its original plans for 2021 were derailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  For years, the company had asked the Indian government to loosen rules that required foreign-owned single-brand retailers to obtain 30% of the value of products sold in India from suppliers in the country. Apple had argued the figure was unrealistic - at least in the short term - as it virtually made all its devices in China.  In 2019, the Indian government relaxed some investment rules, exempting companies selling \"cutting-edge\" items, such as Apple's iPhones and iPads, from the requirement. The next year, announcing Apple's plans to open a physical store in India, Mr Cook had said the company had been waiting for approval from the Indian government \"to go in there ourselves\" rather than with a domestic partner. \"I don't want somebody else to run the brand for us,\" he told shareholders. The next year, Apple launched an online store in India. The website, which allows users to ask for customised products, got a \"great reaction\", according to the company.", "These new retail locations mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers. To celebrate the opening of the new Apple BKC store, Apple has created special wallpapers for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The company is also promoting a special Apple Music playlist featuring “sounds of Mumbai.” There are also wallpapers and a unique playlist to promote the new Apple Saket store in New Delhi. Last month, Apple opened a new retail store in South Korea’s Gangnam District with a unique glass facade. A report from the Economic Times suggests that some Apple executives including retail chief Deirdre O’Brien will be there for the grand opening. It won’t be a surprise if other Apple executives like CEO Tim Cook will be at the opening day of the first Apple Store in India. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

He joined 9to5Mac to share even more tech news around the world.", "Mr Roy says that Apple's decision to open physical stores in India could be the next step in its branding strategy. \"It's not as if this will change Apple sales in any dramatic way,\" he adds, \"but it is still a key milestone, one that will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience\". Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says.", "Production was disrupted last year at Apple's biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a Covid outbreak and worker protests. That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn. Wedbush's Ives said Apple's India strategy — with both a retail and manufacturing push — mirrors the technology giant's steps it took in the China market 10 years ago. \"As Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,\" Ives said. \"Rome was not built overnight and neither will Apple's broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.\" Correction: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the name of Dan Ives.

More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren’t helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself — and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail. “I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly — who does that?” Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. “I don’t see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future.” India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India’s, has two. But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been growing rapidly.", "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.

Apple said Tuesday it’ll open a store in Mumbai on April 18 and another in New Delhi on April 20. The trip comes seven years after the CEO’s maiden visit in 2016 and coincides with the world’s most valuable company hitting important markers: India sales of iPhones reaching an all-time high and annual iPhone exports from the country reaching billions of dollars. Apple is betting on India to diversify its assembly operations beyond China amid strained Beijing-Washington relations. Cook is set to open Apple’s first India store inside an upscale mall in the Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC as the neighborhood is called.", "The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.", "Two decades after entering India, Apple is gearing up to launch its first set of retail stores in the populous South Asian nation, signaling the tech giant’s growing interest in the market. Apple said on Tuesday it plans to open Apple BKC in Mumbai on April 18 and Apple Saket in Delhi on April 20. The iPhone-maker’s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple’s expansion efforts. Despite being the world’s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple’s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation’s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations “mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.” In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings. The company, which launched its Indian online store in 2020, had initially planned to open its first retail location in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a delay. Apple is also working to turn India into a key global hardware manufacturing hub, thanks in part to the incentives New Delhi is offering to manufacturers to expand their presence in the country."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

The latest version of Android almost always gets a showcase during Google I/O, and we can't imagine 2023 will be much different.

We've now got an Android 14 beta that's available to download, too. Even though that first beta is out, the I/O keynote traditionally serves as an excellent platform for alerting people to Android updates, new features and enhancements. We expect that to continue with Google I/O 2023. Thanks to the Android 14 developer previews and the beta release, we already know some of Android 14's features.

But I remember when we did the first preview in London – and this was the first time performing in front of an audience – a lot of it was crying, like very audibly and very quite loud and unashamed, and very guttural.\" But maybe what's most remarkable, is that this is the first time for Comer (who recently turned 30) on either a New York or London stage. \"I've spoken very kind of publicly, honestly, about the fact that I auditioned a lot for theater,\" she said, \"and a lot of the feedback was, you know, the fact that I wasn't classically trained, hadn't been to drama school.

I think, 'You know, you did such a good job, you nearly did yourself out of this job!'\" In \"Prima Facie,\" Comer plays Tessa Ensler, a young, scrappy British barrister from a working-class background who has no problem defending male sex offenders … that is, until she herself is assaulted by one of her male colleagues.  When Comer's character goes to court and tries to explain why she didn't fight off her attacker, many in the audience seem to relate, and audibly sob.  Miller said she wasn't expecting the audience's tears, which have happened at every performance. Miller, who worked as a human rights lawyer in Australia, and still lives there, said she wrote \"Prima Facie\" (a legal term that means self-evident) to highlight just how much the British and American justice systems fail women who bring sexual assault cases. \"The statistics speak for themselves,\" Miller said. \"One in 10 women actually reports a sexual assault.

Jesse Green, the chief theater critic for The New York Times, described it as “a performance of tremendous skill and improbable stamina.” It was a remarkable win for the 30-year-old English actress, who is best known for playing the assassin Villanelle on the television show “Killing Eve.” She not only took home her first Tony Award on her first try; she won it for her first performance on a major stage. “It kind of felt unattainable,” she told The Times in April of the prospect of doing theater. On Sunday night, Comer thanked Suzie Miller, the writer of “Prima Facie,” which won many awards in Australia and Britain.", "The production has grossed close to $1 million for several weeks of its run, with an average ticket price hovering around $150 and capacity close to 100 percent.  \tThe recoupment comes a week after Comer won the Tony Award for best lead actress in a play. In Prima Facie, written by Suzie Miller and directed by Justin Martin, Comer plays Tessa, a young, ambitious lawyer who defends individuals accused of sexual assault and then goes through the legal system herself as a victim of rape. While accepting her Tony Award on stage, Comer acknowledged the responsibility she feels in taking on the role.   \t“To every person who feels represented by Tessa, this has been the greatest honor and it continues to be,” she said.  \tThe play marks Comer’s Broadway debut. The Killing Eve actress played the role on the West End, where she made her professional stage debut and won an Olivier Award for her performance, for a run that began in April 2022. After being with the role for more than a year, Comer told The Hollywood Reporter that she feels changed by the experience.   \t“I feel like I have so much more trust within myself and who I am. I realized that I was quite fearful last year of a lot of things, especially in my ability to do this.", "And I think that actually, through this experience, I’ve been able to transform that into a sense of trust, which is a really nice feeling,” she said.   \tThe Broadway production is lead produced by James Bierman of Empire Street Productions. Bierman noted the production was able to recoup while also offering lower-priced tickets, including $10 lottery tickets and $45 rush tickets throughout the run.  \t           \t“Bringing Prima Facie to Broadway has been a journey of responsibility and faith that has been met with a response that we only dared to dream of when we set out. Suzie Miller’s urgent play, Justin Martin’s forensic direction, and our design team’s visceral production have been the backdrop for Jodie Comer’s extraordinary performance as Tessa Ensler, and the way that audiences have embraced all of this has been truly humbling,” Bierman said.   \tA film adaptation of Prima Facie is in the works, with Cynthia Erivo set to star and executive produce.

That is what drove Dmitri Mirakyan, 28, a data scientist in New York, to develop YourMove.ai, an AI dating tool that helps users begin and respond to messages. “This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on dating apps,” he said. “So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month later, I built the first version [of the platform] on a Saturday.” Unlike Rizz and a similar app called Keys, Your Move does not yet plug into a user’s keyboard, and you must enter messages manually and it will generate a response. However, Mirakyan says a keyboard update is coming soon. Mirakyan said that he has always struggled with social interaction and reading social cues, and that he built the app for those like him who need help making digital communication seamless. “There’s such a gap currently in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes across,” he said. “Just trying to be honest or communicate a point [can mean] not reading the room or stumbling over ourselves.” Users across the country are embracing the app’s ability to generate responses to romantic messages. Mario Pennetti, a 24-year-old in the Daytona Beach, Fla.", "Careers", "We've officially entered a new circle of online dating hell. Meet Rizz, which according to its App Store profile is an AI-powered \"dating assistant\" that tells Tinder, Hinge, and otherwise dating app users what to say to their online matches. It connects directly to a user's keyboard for easy access, and once installed, all you really have to do is start swiping right — then, from there, just let the bot dictate your every word. Cool. We hate it here. \"There's some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message,\" Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor and Rizz user, told The Washington Post. \"It's like getting started on a term paper.\" And Rizz isn't the only app like this out there. As WaPo notes, a few other apps, including one called YourMove.ai, are currently on the market, while a number of dating app scoundrels have taken to the internet in recent months to tout the supposed dating app prowess of ChatGPT. \"This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on dating apps,\" YourMove.ai founder Dmitri Mirakyan told WaPo. \"So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month later, I built the first version [of the platform].", "” Green said she tweaked some suggested messages to show her own personality, but the AI brought out a side of her that she usually does not show. Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology’s ability to foster deeper human connection. “It’s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,” he said. “It’s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I’m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.” None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. “It’s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,” he said. “Remember when people didn’t want to share that they met on a dating app? That’s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.", "area who recently graduated with a degree in sports business, has been using Your Move to start conversations on Hinge and Bumble. “Before I was like, ‘Tell me about yourself, what do you do,’ et cetera,” he said. “This helped me explore the personality of someone a little better. Today, I used it, and one of the things it said to ask was, ‘What’s your favorite dinosaur?’ It’s such a basic thing to ask, but it shows personality.” Miranda Green, a 33-year-old climate reporter in Los Angeles, said Your Move has made dating apps more enjoyable. “I think it kept me from having these monotonous-sounding conversations and made things actually engaging,” she said. Green said multiple men with whom she matched complimented her conversational skills and ability to ask thoughtful questions. One even asked her out after she sent the first AI-generated message. “Wow, there’s so much to be said about that,” her match had replied. “It kind of made me feel a little bit like an impostor, but also it kept me from just saying kind of the same thing over and over again, and clearly it worked,” she said. “I actually had a guy say to me, ‘I was trying to think of a winning thing to say to you and you beat me to the punch.", "What I will call a success is when people are proud to use Keys to communicate because it means you’re working on yourself to be a better communicator.” Some users aren’t just using AI for messaging; they’re also leveraging AI tools to optimize themselves in every feature of a dating app. Dax Flame, 31, a content creator in Los Angeles, began an experiment this year to let AI run every aspect of his life while he documented the journey on YouTube. “I used ChatGPT to help me with a bio on Tinder and message the first matches I got,” he said. “I asked for the ideal bio. Some of the aspects didn’t fit me, but it felt nice and conversational. Eventually, I asked for a more personalized version, and that one was a little bit better. I cut out the guitar strummer part because I don’t play guitar.” Your Move also recently rolled out a feature that helps generate the perfect dating app profile. Slate writer Heather Tal Murphy also turned to ChatGPT to land dates for a friend on the dating apps Tinder and Bumble. “ChatGPT encouraged an odd strain of forwardness that was helpful in getting the dates set up quickly,” Tal Murphy wrote. are you not impressed? because I am https://t.co/uWLchKL432 pic.twitter.com/7fHtYWEEDq Suman Kanuganti, the founder of Personal.", "“Some of the responses were so absurd that they ended up being funny, but not in the way the app likely intended.” He said he doesn’t plan on using the app again. “I anticipate that I’ll continue these conversations manually,” Lloyd said.", ", a service that allows you to create a personalized AI bot that can have conversations with people as you, said that he believes any future AI dating integrations must be tailored to reflect a user’s personality. “When you do offloading or are leveraging AI in the situations of dating, it has to be authentic to a particular individual,” he said. That lack of personalization is part of what ultimately caused Lloyd, the investor, to lose faith in the AI dating tool. Throughout his experience using Rizz, the AI constructed a slew of strange and often outright false messages. “You can imagine a world where Tinder and Hinge have all your chats and offer up the type of thing you’d say in a scenario that’s authentic to your voice,” he said. But in the meantime, “it was hilariously bad, again and again.” Ironically, there are two viral AI apps called Rizz. The one Lloyd used was founded by four college students: Charis Zhang, 20, Oliver Johansson, 20, Tobias Worledge, 19, all sophomores at the University of California at Berkeley, and Daniel He, 20, a sophomore at the University of Southern California. “We’re all [computer science] majors who stay in our rooms all day coding,” Zhang said. “The reason we created this app is that we’re experiencing the pain of not fully knowing how to converse with people.", "Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. \"There's such a gap currently,\" he told the newspaper, \"in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes across.\" That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here. Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we should shoot a little higher.

The 48-year-old will replace Earnie Stewart, who left U.S. Soccer in January to take a role with Dutch power PSV. Crocker joins from Southampton, where he is currently serving as the club’s director of football operations. Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England’s youth international teams for both men and women. “I’m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as sporting director,” Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. “The immediate focus is supporting where I can the women’s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand… Leading the search for the next men’s coach is an opportunity I’m excited about.” Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women’s national team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but “will immediately begin the process of hiring the head coach of the Men’s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women’s National Team general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.” Crocker’s first, and arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men’s national team head coach ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.", "The United States Soccer Federation is searching for a new sporting director to oversee its men’s and women’s national teams following the sudden and unexpected departure of Earnie Stewart, who had held the job since 2019.

The twin moves have all sorts of implications for the federation, particularly as it relates to the vacant USMNT coaching job. Here are four key questions for the fed following the news. Who replaces Earnie Stewart, Brian McBride?   On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone indicated that McBride’s position might not be filled at all.  \"We're going to evaluate the entire sporting department, and that includes the [men’s] GM role,\" Parlow Cone said. \"We're not dead set on having the exact same structure on the men's side as we do have on the women's side, and we're going to be evaluating that and seeing what changes we need to make.\" When it comes to Stewart’s replacement, there are few obvious candidates.", "Anthony Hudson is currently serving as an interim but has repeatedly said he’s not looking for the full-time gig. Gregg Berhalter is out of contract, but U.S. Soccer has said he remains a candidate after he was forthcoming in an investigation about the details of a 1992 domestic violence incident. Crocker began his career at Cardiff, where he served as a development coach for the club’s youth teams, before taking on a role at Southampton overseeing the academy setup. During his first tenure with the Saints, players like Gareth Bale, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Luke Shaw and James Ward-Prowse came through the club’s academy. The Welshman bolstered his reputation during his time with the FA between 2013 and 2020, where he oversaw U-17 and U-20 World Cup wins for the men’s team in 2017 and helped establish an overall playing and coaching strategy called the “England DNA.” He then returned to Southampton where he’s overseen the men’s, women’s and youth teams for the Saints. The women’s team has won back-to-back promotions over the last two seasons. U.S. women’s national team general manager Kate Markgraf will report to Crocker, while it is still unclear if U.S. Soccer will hire a USMNT general manager to replace Brian McBride, who departed along with Stewart in January.

Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That’s a daunting position, but it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.

As the Sporting Director, Stewart will oversee U.S. Soccer’s entire Sports Performance Department, including the men’s and women’s senior and youth National Team programs, to create a more streamlined structure, align the overall technical approach and ensure greater communication and sharing of best practices within Federation programs. Reporting directly to the CEO, Stewart will also oversee all other Sports Performance departments, including Talent Identification, High Performance and Analytics. This framework will lead to enhanced player development, more clearly defined pathways through the National Teams pyramid and help drive the ultimate goal, which is winning championships with the senior teams. At the same time, efforts to increase participation in the sport overall will be aided through his influence on coaching education, referee training and club development. “This is a great day for the Federation and for soccer in America,\" said U.S. Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro. “In Earnie Stewart and Kate Markgraf, we’re keeping our commitment to ensure that soccer operations are run by soccer experts.", "CHICAGO (April 25, 2023) – The U.S. Soccer Federation has appointed Matt Crocker as the next Sporting Director.

The role has been vacant since Earnie Stewart departed last month. In 2019, it was essentially created for Stewart, who extended his responsibilities beyond the U.S. men's national team, to all of U.S. Soccer's national teams and even to the sport's broader American ecosystem. But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they are calling \"a global search\" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description. President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire before July's Women's World Cup, will \"really focus on our national teams ... and our technical plan at the elite level.\" They have essentially split Stewart's job — which \"was huge,\" Parlow Cone said — into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to referee development, and on \"growing youth and adult participation,\" Batson said.

And, you know, it's so exciting as well to explore, like, as you say, a female villain. The dark feminine is so beautiful because it's something that we have had to quash. We've had to deny. Getting to show the light and the dark sitting together was really so exciting for me. CHANG: Nida Manzoor directed the new film, \"Polite Society.\" Thank you so much for sharing this time with us. I so enjoyed this. MANZOOR: Oh, thank you, Ailsa. It was so much fun to chat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2023 NPR.", "And again, so much of what excites me are those nuances, those small moments between the family. Like the family’s having dinner around the table: what's the family eating? They could eat pasta. “Shouldn't they be eating a curry?” No. They don't need to. The mixing of the cultures and the different layers is just so exciting to see. The final act is a big Bollywood-inspired set piece at the wedding. It's really over the top and showcases the beauty of South Asian culture. [Then we also show the characters] at school, dressed in school uniforms, which are sort of British.  I'm also mixing all the genres I love; referencing all the movies I love. I would describe Polite Society as an action-comedy about sisterhood. The film is filled with action scenes; heights; crazy over-the-top violence, fun, and comedy. It was a chance for me to mix all the films I grew up on—the Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies.  Polite Society official trailer  For me, the action in the film really represents what it feels like to be a teenage girl—how it can feel so painful and violent when you're having fights at school, when you're fighting with your sister. It has a real kind of visceral feeling. So we wanted to show that with fight sequences. It's wanting to show these kinds of small violences whilst using big, over-the-top action.", "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter A Letter From Filmmaker Nida Manzoor About Polite Society  The writer-director offers an inside look at her new action-comedy Sundance feature Share on Facebook Share on Twitter This started for me about 10 years ago when I had the idea to make the film. I wrote the first draft when I was in my early 20s, and I was just trying to get it made. It was only in the last couple years that we've found the right partners to make it with. So it's been a long road, but I got to make the feature film of my dreams. I feel like I'm kind of the most ready I've ever been to make it.  Actor Priya Kansara and director Nida Manzoor on the set of Polite Society. I knew I wanted to make a film that was about two sisters, that really foregrounds this sisterly love story, because I don't think we get to see that a lot in films, especially not with action and dance numbers. It was drawn a lot from my own relationship with my sister, such a close, intimate, and loving relationship. But then, when you fight with your siblings, that kind of fighting can be the most brutal.  It's important to me to show a South Asian family [the way I did], because it's sort of been my experience.", "She’s from the indie cinema space, and we wanted that. I wanted her to stay true to herself as a DP. She loves to go handheld. She loves it to feel a little bit bursting at the seams. There’s a wildness and a freedom to the way she shoots. It was just a thrill to get to work with her. Prepping with Ashley is the most fun ever; we just swap film references, watch lots of films, and constantly remind each other of the films that are inspiring us as we shoot. We’re like, “70’s Scorsese! It can be a bit out of focus.” We were looking at Park Chan-wook’s movies, his Vengeance Trilogy being both stylized but also fizzing. It’s not overly stylized, there’s a vibrancy of movement within the frame, and we wanted to bring that to it. It was just constantly back and forth, sharing references, and having a really great time.   Polite Society is playing in theaters nationwide.", "When Manzoor looks at her Bollywood influences, one person who comes to mind is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The popular actress served as an inspiration for the character of Ria in Polite Society. Rai Bachchan — who has starred in films such as Jeans, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and Devdas — is a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and Manzoor admires her body's agility and strength, which also influences Ria's dream to become a stunt performer.  Seeing Jordan Peele's game-changing horror flick Get Out — which put Black actors center stage and was infused with social commentary — convinced Manzoor that Polite Society could one day end up on the big screen, too. \"I remember feeling the audience respond to [Get Out] and thinking maybe there was a place for my film,\" she recalls. Peele's use of humor in the 2017 movie also taught Manzoor something very important: \"I didn't realize how much you could use comedy to help keep the audience with you.\" Kill Bill is one of the many films to inspire the action sequences in Polite Society. There is a fight that takes place between Ria and her sister Lena, which is gritty and more grounded than some of the other bigger battle scenes in the movie. It take inspiration from the Bourne films and the Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah brawl in Kill Bill.", "Even as Lena and Salim’s courtship appears headed to the altar, Salim is still creepily tied to the apron strings of his mysterious mother, Raheela (Nimra Bucha). It’s a good thing Ria has the loyal, all-in support of her besties Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) and Clara (Seraphina Beh), who have her back no matter how crazy things get.  As the story unfolds, audiences are treated to extravagant fight scenes, tight action sequences, and a showstopping Bollywood dance number, all filtered through the experience of one girl coming of age. As such, the script doesn’t shy away from female rage and issues around identity, making the film a unique delight for viewers who’ve rarely seen themselves reflected onscreen.  Manzoor discussed Polite Society with The Credits, pointing to her influences and revealing how her collaborations were integral to making this unusual genre-bending film successful on so many levels.    Polite Society is a love note to your favorite genre movies growing up. Some films mentioned as inspiration are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix, and the Bollywood classic, Devdas. What specific moments might be a callback only fans of those films would recognize?", "With two unique stories under her belt, Manzoor talked to EW about what inspired her first film and who her biggest influences are as a storyteller. Polite Society is a mix of thrilling action sequences and comedy, so it's no surprise that one of Manzoor's biggest influences is Jackie Chan. \"I love watching Jackie Chan movies,\" shares Manzoor. \"As a kid, I thought his mix of comedy and martial arts was something that got me excited about cinema.\" The director fondly remembers going to see Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour and being blown away by not only how funny it was but that the big-screen comedy starred people of color. The 1998 classic was her gateway to Chan's other work, including Police Story and Drunken Master.  Bollywood spectacles have also had a real impact on Manzoor's work. \"I grew up on a very heavy diet of Bollywood movies,\" she says of the weekly trips she took to the cinema with her mother growing up. One of her favorites is the 2002 film Devdas, based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's 1917 novel about a law graduate who returns to London to marry his childhood friend. \"That film stands out because I was so impressed with the filmmaker,\" she shares. \"I feel like we sometimes look down on Bollywood cinema in the West and I remember being so moved by the craft of that film in particular.", "Polite Society is a 2023 British action comedy-drama film written and directed by Nida Manzoor (in her feature film directorial debut). The film stars Priya Kansara, Ritu Arya, Nimra Bucha, Akshay Khanna, Seraphina Beh, Ella Bruccoleri, Shona Babayemi, Shobu Kapoor, and Jeff Mirza.  Polite Society had its world premiere at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2023, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 28 April 2023 by Focus Features. The film received favourable reviews from critics.  In London, British-Pakistani teenager Ria Khan aspires to become a movie stuntwoman like her idol, Eunice Huthart. Under an alter-ego, \"The Fury\", Ria creates films of martial arts training with the help of her older sister Lena, who has dropped out of art school and moved back in with their loving but traditional parents, Fatima and Rafe, both of them discouraging Ria's dreams.   At school, Ria is inseparable from her friends Clara and Alba, but their disapproving teacher urges her to pursue a more \"serious\" career. Ria's emails to Eunice about a potential mentorship go unanswered, and she is soundly defeated by the school bully Kovacs.", "Manzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. \"It made me believe that our stories are worth being told,\" Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almodóvar. \"He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\" Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. \"Each of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I gravitate to,\" she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane Austen's works have always resonated with her. \"There's something in the way she explores the pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own,\" she says.  Polite Society is in theaters now.", "Lena subdues Salim while Ria finally masters a reverse spinning kick to defeat Raheela, and the police arrive as the sisters drive off. Reconciling with Lena, Ria finally receives an encouraging email from Eunice, and the sisters celebrate together.  In January 2022 it was revealed a feminist action comedy focusing on two British-Pakistani sisters was being filmed in London by Nida Manzoor with Working Title, Focus Features and Parkville Pictures, with a tone and voice similar to Manzoor’s breakthrough and BAFTA, Peabody, and Rose d'Or award winning sitcom series We Are Lady Parts.[5]  In February 2022 it was announced that filming had wrapped on the project in London. It is produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner for Working Title with Olivier Kaempfer and John Pocock for Parkville Pictures.

I’ve even gone long on it here in Paste’s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series’ press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn’t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew’s now Fay-less Season 3 future—or even if, indeed, it’s likely to see such a future—it was nevertheless a delight.

Everyone who considered it outrageous that Huckabee Sanders could be insulted in such a high-profile setting needs to be reminded that she’s now the governor of Arkansas, where so far she’s banned the use of the word “Latinx,” rolled back child labor laws, and recently endorsed koozies lauding the election of “real women,” a blatant attempt to debase the trans community while trolling Bud Light.

Here’s how it works. Everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold  Update: See our full Google Pixel Fold review for our detailed report on how it performs.  The Google Pixel Fold is here to show that there can be more than one major player when it comes to the best foldable phones. Google’s first foldable arrives with a lot of anticipation, especially since Samsung will soon unleash its fifth such device in the Galaxy Z Fold 5. So was the Pixel Fold worth the wait and what makes it stand out? Let’s break it down. The Pixel Fold boasts the thinnest design you’ll find in a foldable phone, a wide cover display that's easy to use and, of course, Pixel-grade cameras. However, at $1,799, the Pixel Fold doesn’t come cheap. Here’s everything you need to know, and check out our roundup of 5 reasons to buy the Pixel Fold and 3 reasons to skip. And check out our interview with the Pixel Fold's project manager to get the inside scoop on this device.   Google Pixel Fold pre-orders started back on May 10, with June 27 being the day it'll be released broadly. The Pixel Fold price starts at $1,799 for the 256GB model and goes up to $1,919 for 512GB.", "Other than the US, the Pixel Fold is only launching in the UK, Germany, and Japan. A deep apology to our neighbors up north. Google's first foldable is just around the corner, and pre-ordering gets you a free Pixel Watch — not bad. With a massive expansive display inside and a traditional form factor upfront, it looks to be one of the best folding phones we've seen yet. The Google Pixel Fold looks like you would expect a book-style folding phone to look like. It has an unassuming display on the exterior with an aspect ratio of roughly 17.5:9. This means it's a little shorter and boxier than many regular smartphone screens out there that typically come with a 20:9 ratio, but it's arguably a more usable form factor than the Fold 4's all-too-narrow 23:9 screen, which makes buttons cramped and squishes a lot of apps that weren't designed for a screen this tall. On the back, the familiar Pixel camera bar greets you, which Google first introduced with the Pixel 6 series and then further refined with the Pixel 7. In contrast to the regular Pixel phones, the Pixel Fold's bar doesn't fully extend to the rim of the back, which is likely a structural engineering decision, as it could lead to issues with the hinge. It still retains the familiar Pixel design that Google established. The back is otherwise understated, with nothing but the familiar G logo in the middle.", "Pixel May 10, 2023 min read            Whether open or closed, there are endless ways of having fun and getting things done.          Google Pixel Fold is now available for pre-order and will begin shipping next month. Our new foldable phone combines the helpfulness of Pixel with a design that unfolds into a compact tablet, unlocking even more ways for you to use your device. And it’s all powered by our Google Tensor G2 chip, which also makes Pixel Fold fast and secure. Here’s a look at the newest addition to our Pixel portfolio. When closed, Pixel Fold has a familiar smartphone silhouette that fits in the palm of your hand and slides into your pocket. Flip it open to reveal a 7.6-inch screen with a thinner profile than any other foldable phone in the market.1 To create this foldable design, we didn’t compromise on form and function. Many of the Pixel components — from camera, battery, speakers and haptics technology — were cleverly redesigned to fit within the thin design. Our custom-built hinge not only contributes to that thinness, but also doubles as the most durable hinge out there.2 And last but not least, Pixel Fold has an IPX8 rating for water resistance. Whether it’s open or closed, the Pixel Fold’s screens unlock endless ways of having fun and getting things done.", "By  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.  If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The rumors are true: next week, Google will introduce its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, during the Google I/O 2023 event.  Google hasn’t revealed any specs for the device, but a brief teaser video shows off a full-size outer display on a phone that opens up similarly to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices. The camera bar on the back is similar to other Pixel devices but doesn’t stick out as prominently, reflecting what we’ve seen in leaked marketing materials and even a hands-on video. CNBC reported in April that the Pixel Fold would be a 5.8-inch phone that folds out into a 7.6-inch tablet. It’ll reportedly include a Google Tensor G2 processor, weigh 10 ounces, and have “the most durable hinge on a foldable,” along with a price that’s over $1,700. Samsung’s latest foldable, the Z Fold 4, launched with a price of $1,799. We had expected to see it last year, but the Fold didn’t make the cut for I/O in 2022, and rumors about its launch haven’t slowed down in the year since.", "Look, I’m not going to sit here and pretend that the entire world didn’t know this was happening next week, but is a bit of theatrics too much to ask? Google learned a few years back that the best way to juice a product hype cycle is to “leak” the thing yourself, and here we are, facing down a tweet that leaves very little to the imagination. The short video shows the company’s upcoming Pixel Fold unfolding slowly from every conceivable angle. Google’s using Star Wars Day as an excuse to fire up the old hype train, but the truth is it’s priming up the pump with less than a week before it returns to Shoreline for an in-person I/O. There were already a LOT of leaks and rumors floating around, so the company just went ahead and took matters into its own hands. There’s also an official Pixel Fold page where you can sign up for news and the like. There’s still some information that hasn’t been made official, including pricing and release date.

The dimensions, on the other hand, appear a bit closer to Oppo’s recent foldable, or even Microsoft’s bygone Surface Duo.", "The Google Fold phone is the first entry to the US folding phone market after Samsung After years of rumors, Google finally unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023, its first folding phone that goes head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Like Samsung's flagship foldable, the Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone that has a regular smartphone-like screen on the front and a tablet-like display on the inside. We'll still have to wait a few more weeks until we can get our hands on it, but here is everything Google has announced so far. While Google already announced the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023 (and teased it on Twitter beforehand), the Google Pixel Fold will only ship on June 27. This is right in line with some previous hardware releases at I/O, like the Pixel 6a, which was only released to stores after more than a month after the event. If you're convinced the Pixel Fold is for you, you can preorder it right now from the Google Store for $1,800. It's an expensive price, but you'll get a free Pixel Watch as part of pre-purchasing. It was long rumored that Google would try and undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 4 in price, but as we can see now, this isn't the case. The phone is available in a dark Obsidian and a light Porcelain colorway.", "However, people who secured a pre-order of the Pixel Fold have been noting the shipping date for Google's first folding phone has slipped from june 27 to between July 3 and July 7. This may be an indication that Google underestimated demand for the Pixel Fold.  Speaking of pre-orders, if you opt to get the Google Pixel Fold through AT&T you can save a huge 50%. You'll need to sign up for three years of AT&T service, but doing so reduces the cost of the Pixel Fold to $900.  We asked Google about the Pixel Fold's high price in an interview and the product manager provided some interesting answers.  Google says the Pixel Fold will be available in the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan, at least for now. The Fold will be available through all three major carriers in the U.S. Google Pixel pre-orders include a free Google Pixel Watch, which is valued at $349.  The Google Store may be the best place to get it though, at least in the U.S., thanks to some incredibly generous trade-in bonuses.  Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 4 (and presumably the Z Fold 5), the Pixel Fold unfolds in a book-like fashion to reveal a large 7.6-inch display. But Google's design is actually quite different from what Samsung offers. Google claims that the Pixel Fold has the thinnest profile of any foldable, as it measures just 6.2 x 5.", "Google has focused on teaching Android developers to make their apps work on foldable devices and larger screens, which may pay off next week with the launch of this device and the new Pixel Tablet.

With this year's developer conference now out of the way, the cat is finally out of the bag, and we will soon be able to get our hands on Google's first foldable. We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch.

Now they just need to get cheaper. By Brian X. Chen Brian X. Chen, the lead consumer technology writer, is the author of Tech Fix, a column about the social implications of the tech we use. When I recently turned on Google’s new Pixel Fold smartphone and unfolded it as if it were a book, it transformed into a miniature tablet, similar to an iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. Then something unexpected happened. For the next few hours, I found it difficult to put the device down, as if I were sucked into a great novel. The phone’s performance was smooth and fast, and the bigger screen made reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen. I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware. But I immediately knew the Pixel Fold — Google’s first foldable phone — was different. When I folded the device back up, a second 5.8-inch outer screen illuminated, converting it into a regular smartphone that could be used with one hand.", "The catch: In the past, Google’s A-series smartphones were mostly known for one thing: their seriously aggressive price tags. Earlier models routinely debuted for less than $500, which made them easy recommendations for smartphone shoppers on tighter budgets. This one isn’t quite as cheap, and faces stiff competition from rival Samsung devices. What it is: Google’s first new Android tablet since 2015 How much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Double duty as a portable screen and smart home machine Sure, you could stick Google's new 11-inch Pixel Tablet into your bag and tote it around for a day — it's sleek and boasts a screen bright enough for outdoor reading or Netflix bingeing. But that's not where the company thinks the Tablet will spend most of its time. Instead, they figure it’ll mostly live at home — and perhaps perched on an included dock that charges the tablet and plays audio through a built-in speaker. (Naturally, it sounds a lot better than just listening through the tablet’s speakers cranked up, though it’s worth noting you can’t use the dock as a stand-alone Bluetooth speaker or anything.) When it’s sitting on that dock, the Tablet basically becomes an even bigger version of the company’s Nest Hub screens, offering quick access to streaming media, your smart home gadgets, Google’s ever-ready Assistant.", "Alphabet Inc.’s Google introduced a $1,799 foldable smartphone, a new entry-level Pixel phone and a tablet for the home, its latest attempt to spark hardware sales in an arena saturated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Launched at Wednesday’s Google I/O conference, the Pixel Fold is Google’s first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its 2022 flagship phone’s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.  The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google’s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung’s latest Galaxy Z Fold 4 and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables — with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC — having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.", "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — For many watching Google's I/O developer conference this week, the big draw is a full breakdown of the company's broader AI plans. But the company hasn’t just been working on software. During the conference’s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets — including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display — as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren’t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It’s not clear what role — if any — Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company’s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here’s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.", "I suspect that in a few years, foldable phones will probably fall in price to replace current phones with the “pro” moniker and will make up the new high end of the market.

More about Brian X.", "Apart from its folding design, Google’s pricey new phone also mostly sticks to familiar territory — we haven’t seen much so far that sets it apart from other Pixels and other foldables. Google may well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road — we know the company is working on an “interpreter mode” for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations — but it feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google’s most thoughtful software features, on a budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7, kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though, this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more expensive devices offered.", "Google is also banking on two more conventional devices as it attempts again to make headway in the hardware market. The Pixel 7a looks like last year’s Pixel 7, but uses more basic components and trims back the list of features. Its screen is 25% brighter than the preceding model and has a faster, 90-hertz refresh rate. There’s also face unlock, enhanced camera zoom, and a 64-megapixel rear camera, making it one of the more compelling low-end smartphones. A year after announcing the product, Google shared more details about its tablet. The device’s specifications — including the company’s G2 processor, 128GB of storage, 8MP front and rear cameras and hardware design — are by this point dated compared with rival devices. Its price — $499 — also eclipses some iPad models, though the Google device includes a home dock to stand it upright.

It plans to announce the device at its annual developer conference, Google I/O, on May 10. The Pixel Fold, known internally by the codename \"Felix,\" will have the \"most durable hinge on a foldable\" phone, according to the documents. It will cost upward of $1,700 and compete with Samsung's $1,799 Galaxy Z Fold 4. Google plans to market the Pixel Fold as water-resistant and pocket-sized, with an outside screen that measures 5.8 inches across, according to the documents.", "6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes — it’s more than nice enough to take in your daily allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side. The big bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less. And because the Fold physically bends in half, there’s a great chance of some kind of physical failure over time.

That leaves Google — long an also-ran in the U.S. smartphone market — with an opportunity. And thankfully, the company’s first attempt at a folding phone feels very different from the others you can buy right now. For one, this book-style foldable isn’t as awkward to use as some models. The Fold has a 5.8-inch external screen, and it’s proportions are pretty close to traditional smartphone screens. Rival models from Samsung, for example, have taller and slimmer displays on the outside, so sending text messages and browsing the web can feel a little awkward. Thankfully, that’s not the case here. It doesn’t hurt that the Pixel Fold is noticeably thinner than other Samsung options, either. At last: a folding smartphone that won’t feel super awkward in your back pocket.

As a nation, we now find ourselves at a different point in the pandemic – with more tools and resources than ever before to better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the agency’s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at highest risk of severe COVID-19.

Microsoft recently laid off its ethics and society team within the artificial intelligence organization. The team had been working to identify risks posed by Microsoft’s adoption of OpenAI’s language models throughout its software and services. That’s left some inside and outside Microsoft concerned at the pace of AI-powered software, but Spataro doesn’t share the same concerns. “To serve the unmet needs of our customers, we must move quickly and responsibly, learning as we go,” says Spataro. “ We’re testing Copilot with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale, and we will expand to more soon.” Microsoft is clearly starting small to ensure any costly mistakes are discovered early on. “When the system gets things wrong, or has biases, or is misused, we have mitigations in place,” says Jamie Teevan, Microsoft’s chief scientist. “We’re tackling the long term implications and novel risks like jailbreaks.", "What does Microsoft Bing’s new AI assistant mean for your business? Your email has been sent      Learn what Prometheus means for Microsoft’s approach to artificial intelligence.   Microsoft has launched an AI-powered update of its Bing search engine. It’s not surprising, as we’ve lived with the same algorithmic approach to search since the launch of Google more than 20 years ago, so any innovation is going to get attention. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called it “a Mosaic moment” — referring to the early internet browser and pointing to a very interesting future for software. Before the Mosaic browser, the World Wide Web was simply a way to explore and share documents; after the early browser launched in 1993, it became the user interface to the wider internet. AI in Bing is much the same, as it’s the start of a series of experiments that could change the way we interact with software.

The Copilot, powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft’s Copilot leaked earlier today. “It works alongside you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more,” said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. “Copilot is a whole new way of working.” Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can also be summoned throughout Microsoft’s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on other files.

The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.  The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1][2][3][4] (sometimes later called \"Clippy\"), after a paperclip. Clippit was the default, and by far the most notable, Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.[5] The Office Assistant and particularly Clippit have been the subject of numerous criticism and parodies.

Those days are long gone — so much so that if you say “Hey Cortana” to your Windows 11 computer you won’t get an answer, because the virtual assistant is turned off by default. Which might make you think Cortana is all but dead. But it’s not. In fact, Microsoft has big plans for it — but very different ones from when the product was first released. The company has been uncharacteristically low-key about what it plans for Cortana’s future, so it might have fallen off your radar. It hasn’t fallen off ours, though. We’ve done a fair amount of digging, talked to the head of Cortana development at Microsoft, and interviewed tech industry analysts for their opinions.

The Microsoft Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants, Saeko Sensei (冴子先生), an animated secretary, and a version of the Monkey King (Chinese: 孫悟空) for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions.[19] Native language versions provided additional representations, such as Kairu the dolphin in Japanese.  Since their introduction, more assistants have been released and have been exclusively available via download.[20][1]  The 12 assistants for Office 97 could be downloaded from the Microsoft website.[22]  The feature drew a strongly negative response from many users.[23][24] Microsoft turned off the feature by default in Office XP, acknowledging its unpopularity in an ad campaign spoofing Clippy.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac, as it continued to draw criticism even from Microsoft employees.

Results are parsed and used as inputs into the model, looking for fresh insights that can drive additional searches, an approach that Microsoft described as a “virtuous loop.” The initial implementation of this AI tooling is in both its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Microsoft gave a picture of how the service will eventually appear in the rest of the company’s productivity tooling. In Edge, a new Bing sidebar lets you take searches outside the traditional browser, giving a clue to how it could be implemented in the familiar Office applications. The new sidebar design Microsoft has been rolling out across Office is very much like the Bing AI tooling that’s being trialed in the developer release of the Edge browser. While Microsoft has yet to announce any plans to provide API-level access to this tooling, it would be surprising if it wasn’t on the company’s radar.

We plan to give select Pixel phones early access later this year.          Since its launch in 2015, Google Photos has used AI to help you get the most out of your memories — from automatically organizing and resurfacing your photos to helping you edit them with advanced tools like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur. Today at I/O, we gave a sneak peek of Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you reimagine your photos and make editing even easier. With Magic Editor, you’ll be able to make complex edits without pro-level editing skills. Using a combination of AI techniques, including generative AI, it will help you make edits to specific parts of an image — like the subject, sky or background — so you have even more control over the final look and feel of your photo. Sometimes the difference between a so-so picture and the perfect shot comes down to getting the framing just right. Magic Editor will help you improve the overall composition of your photo by allowing you to reposition the subject of your shot to the best spot. For example, if you’re trying to get the perfect photo from your time at a popular waterfall, you could remove the bag strap you forgot to take off. You could also make the sky brighter and less cloudy, so it matches how you remember that day.", "In the Adobe Life Blog interview, Levoy said that while his role at Google was to \"democratize good photography\", his mission at Adobe is instead to \"democratize creative photography\". And that involves \"marrying pro controls to computational photography image processing pipelines\". In other words, Google and others have now taken the baton of \"democratizing good photography\", while Adobe's programs use machine-learning power to improve the workflows of amateurs and pros who need the finer craft of manual photo edits. The death of Photoshop is a long way off, then, even if many of its mass market tools are being automated by phones. These are still early days in the AI photo editing revolution and Google's new tools are far from the only ones out there. Desktop editors like Luminar Neo, ImagenAI and Topaz Labs are all impressive AI assistants that can enhance (or rescue) your imperfect photos.   But Google's Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser go a step further by living in our Pixel phones – and they'll surely migrate to our Google Photos libraries, too. This step would really take them to a mass audience, who'll be able to turn their holiday snaps or family photos into polished masterpieces without needing to know what an adjustment layer is. As for Adobe and Photoshop, we'll likely see some new Sensei announcements at Adobe's Max 2022 conference from October 18.", "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It’s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents — and potentially, the meaning — of a photo in much more significant ways. While it’s clear that this tool isn’t flawless — and there remains no firm release date for it — Google’s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.", "Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "It uses AI to deliver recommendations based on you and your work and includes one-click actions to speed you to results.

Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.", "Today we release a new version of Photoshop on the desktop and iPad.

The Discover panel is loaded with tools and tips to help you work faster.", "The company markets the tool as a way to “make complex edits without pro-level editing tools,” allowing you to leverage the power of AI to single out and transform a portion of your photo. That includes the ability to enhance the sky, move and scale subjects, as well as remove parts of an image with just a few taps. Google’s Magic Editor attempts to package all the steps that it would take to make similar edits in a program like Photoshop into a single tap — or, at least, that’s what it looks like from the demo. In Photoshop, for example, you’re stuck using the Content-Aware Move tool (or any of the other methods of your choice) to pick up and move a subject inside of an image. Even then, the photo still might not look quite right, which means you’ll have to pick up other tools, like the Clone Stamp tool or maybe even the Spot Healing Brush, to fix any leftover artifacts or a mismatched background. It’s not the most complicated process ever, but as with most professional creative tools, there’s a definite learning curve for people who are new to the program. I’m all for Google making photo editing tools free and more accessible, given that Photoshop and some of the other image editing apps out there are expensive and pretty unintuitive. But putting powerful and incredibly easy-to-use image editing tools into the hands of, well, just about everyone who downloads Google Photos could transform the way we edit — and look at — photos.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "In addition to new smart devices, Google teased a new AI-enhanced Magic Editor tool at this year’s annual I/O conference. Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’ libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.  Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee.

He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t seem fazed by Apple’s introduction of the Vision Pro.  In a companywide meeting with Meta employees today that The Verge watched, the CEO said Apple’s device didn’t present any major breakthroughs in technology that Meta hadn’t “already explored” and that its vision for how people will use the device is “not the one that I want.” He also pointed to the fact that Meta’s upcoming Quest 3 headset will be much cheaper, at $499 compared to the Vision Pro’s $3,499 price tag, giving Meta the opening to reach a wider user base. “I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this in a way that I think is really important,” Zuckerberg told employees, who were gathered at the company’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters for its first all-hands meeting since 2020. Zuckerberg said that the Quest is about “people interacting in new ways and feeling closer” while also “about being active and doing things.” “I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this” “By contrast, every demo that they showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself,” he said of Apple’s WWDC keynote earlier this week.", "Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.", "Apple is already working on a new version of the Apple Vision Pro that will be priced more affordably. Apple plans to charge $3,499 for the Vision Pro when it launches in 2024, but the company wants to create a model that has a lower cost to broaden the appeal of the device. Apple engineers plan to use more affordable components to bring the price down, but the lower-priced headset will have the same general AR/VR \"mixed reality\" functionality of the Vision Pro. The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone. Apple is expected to offer a more affordable model and a follow up to the higher-end and more expensive first-generation model. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \"contact lenses\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s.", "Apple is planning an in-store, appointment-only rollout of its flagship virtual reality headset Vision Pro, Bloomberg reported on Friday, underscoring the complexities behind the company’s most consequential product launch in years as it faces manufacturing difficulties, high costs and a struggling effort to whip up mass-market appeal for what is mostly still a niche product. The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask—including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses—necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.", "Checking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday considered a new angle on Apple's divisive virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, linking the product to the ongoing battles between the most popular wireless carriers. Some were shocked just a few weeks ago when Apple execs revealed the Vision Pro's price tag: at $3,500 a pop, the Vision Pro is one of Apple's more expensive consumer products. Cramer noted that some rationalized the steep cost by figuring Apple's Vision Pro would open the doors for less expensive headsets of a similar ilk. But Cramer sees potential for major wireless carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T to capitalize on the new product by offering discounts on plans in exchange for cheaper phones.", "Apple did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. The Vision Pro is Apple’s much anticipated foray into virtual reality and its launch could be as important to the company as its other major products like the iPhone. It is billed as a mixed reality headset that blends the virtual and real world—one can switch between full virtual reality and “augmented” reality mixing virtual and real elements—and has been a poorly kept secret that has been years in the making. Investors hope it will fire up interest in the sector, which has been around for years but struggled to take off in a major way. Its high price tag puts it at the upper end of the market—it is working on a cheaper model—which analysts expect will limit initial demand to loyal Apple fans and wealthier customers. The headset’s design and high costs of the technology it uses have reportedly forced Apple to lower its ambitions for the device’s rollout to manage manufacturing difficulties. The issues have reportedly pushed the company to drop its 2024 production goal from more than 1 million units to fewer than 400,000. Apple will push Vision Pro into other markets toward the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg. The U.K. and Canada are reportedly leading candidates for the first sales outside of the U.S., though this has not been settled, with other markets in Asia and Europe to follow shortly after.", "Vision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.", "Where a user looks stays private while navigating Apple Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. Additionally, data from the camera and other sensors is processed at the system level, so individual apps do not need to see a user’s surroundings to enable spatial experiences. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.

Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that “seamlessly” blends the real and digital world. “It’s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,” CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says “hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps” will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset.

Then inside the headset is a ring of LED lights that project invisible patterns onto your eyes to assist with the eye-tracking. These LED lights also power Optic ID, which is the Vision Pro's version of Face ID. Under the hood, the Vision Pro is powered entirely by Apple silicon. An M2 chip does most of the heavy lifting, but a brand-new R1 chip handles the sensor inputs and ensures the display doesn't lag behind. Apple says the R1 chip keeps the input lag of the twin 4K Micro OLED displays at just around 12ms — on par with a lot of the best TVs. Finally, Apple promises spatial audio thanks to a speaker on each side of the headset, near where it connects with your Head Band. These speakers — or audio pods — provide what Apple calls \"the most advanced Spatial Audio system ever.\" The individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod can even be fine-tuned to deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on your head and ears. And it's not only the Apple Vision Pro spec sheet that matters here.

The outlet spotted trademarks in the U.S. and global markets related to the device that were filed by Apple-affiliated firms. Names like “Reality One,” “Reality Pro” and “Reality Processor” were filed by a supposed shell corporation — Immersive Health Solutions LLC — with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The filings asked for the rights related to the use of health assessment and monitoring using VR/AR, designs and development in computer hardware, providing access to databases, educational provisions, photographic and optical instruments and more. Immersive Health Solutions was incorporated in February 2022 and was registered by the Corporation Trust Co., another shell company, it’s assumed, based on ties to a lawyer with ties to Apple and the company’s past filing processes. The initial report also noted the new trademarks were filed under the Immersive Health Solutions’ name in Canada, New Zealand, EU, U.K., Australia, Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica and Uruguay. Apple had previously used a shell company to file its source code referencing realityOS (which is believed to be the name of its AR/VR operating system) in late 2021, according to the site. Filing trademarks under a different company name is not uncommon for Apple.

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.", "According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning to announce its first headset as soon as January next year, with potential features including two 4K micro-OLED displays, 15 optical modules, two main processors, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, eye tracking, object tracking, and hand gesture controls.

Additionally, it’s said to include an even more power-hungry processor than the M1 found on the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. VR is the headset’s primary focus, but it will also offer some AR functionality, per Bloomberg’s initial look at the product. Can Apple keep the AR industry alive?  The new product will find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind. Apple is holding a big event at its Cupertino HQ next week, with the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 serving as headliners.

Apple’s first media event of the fall will take place on September 7, where it will announce its first batch of new products for the holiday season. The headset is not expected to make an appearance, although anything’s possible as Apple will inevitably preview the headset months ahead of its actual release.

Bloomberg reports that companies linked to Apple have applied for names including ‘Reality One’, ‘Reality Pro’ and ‘Reality Processor’. Do not expect the headset to appear as part of the iPhone 14 event on September 7 however. The latest rumors generally point to a product launch of the headset early in 2023. Apple’s interest in the ‘Reality’ branding has been known as far back as 2017, when Bloomberg first reported that Apple was working on ‘rOS’ or realityOS. In 2019, Apple published a developer framework named ‘RealityKit’, to help create augmented reality experiences. Of course, there’s no guarantee that Apple uses any of the proposed trademarks, like the Reality One or Reality Pro names. For a start, they haven’t been granted yet. However, you can see the logic. The AR headset would be Apple’s first product in the space, hence Reality One.  Reality Pro is also viable, as the first-generation headset is rumored to be a high-end device — almost like a tech demo more than mass consumer product — with a hefty ~$2000 price tag, if not more. The headset is expected to feature two super high resolution displays, one for each eye, and a bevy of cameras and sensors.", "Vision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.", "Apple is working on at least three augmented-reality and virtual-reality headset devices, the first of which will likely launch with the name \"Apple Reality Pro,\" according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Concept render based on purported leaked information by Ian ZelboIn the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, Gurman explained that there are a minimum of three Apple headsets actively in development that he is aware of, under the codes \"N301,\" \"N602,\" and \"N421.\" The first of these devices, N301, is what Gurman believes will be called \"Apple Reality Pro.\" Apple Reality Pro is said to be the company's \"high-end rival\" to Meta's upcoming Quest Pro headset. N602 is reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what Apple's first headset product could be called. It is worth noting that the \"Reality Pro\" name lines up with Apple's recent trademark filings. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has trademarked several terms believed to be associated with its upcoming headset devices, including \"Reality Processor,\" \"Reality Pro,\" and \"Reality One.", "CUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) on Monday unveiled a costly augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro in its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O). At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said.

No sleep, and even worse, no idea what you’re doing. When it comes to getting answers, it’s not always straightforward.

Once you find that signal, you build the product or write the story. After completing Paulson’s memoir, Ryder decamped to Southeast Asia, where she served as a journalist for The Economist and The Wall Street Journal. From there she transitioned into venture capital, another industry where being able to spot the trends with staying power has outsized importance.

We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we’re also the richest country that spends the most on health care.
